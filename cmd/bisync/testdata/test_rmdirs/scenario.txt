test rmdirs
# Test the --remove-empty-dirs logic.
# Without this flag the subdir should not be deleted when empty,
# and deleted with the flag.
#
# After the initial setup sync:
#  1. Delete Path1 subdir/file20.txt
#  2. Run bisync without --remove-empty-dirs
#  3. Confirm the subdir still exists on both paths
#  4. Run bisync WITH --remove-empty-dirs
#  5. Confirm the subdir has been removed on both paths
