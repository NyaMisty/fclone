test rclone-args
# Pass generic flags to rclone under test using as an example
# the --size-only flag, which changes the meaning of operations.
# Note that --size-only is honored by the rclone proper, but not bisync.
# Bisync copies the newer {path2/}file21.txt to {path1/}, but `rlcone sync`
# does not copy the newer {path1/}file20.txt to {path2/}.
