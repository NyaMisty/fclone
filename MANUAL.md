## About rclone {#about}

Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage. It
is a feature rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage
interfaces. [Over 40 cloud storage products](#providers) support
rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage
services, as well as standard transfer protocols.

Rclone has powerful cloud equivalents to the unix commands rsync, cp,
mv, mount, ls, ncdu, tree, rm, and cat. Rclone's familiar syntax
includes shell pipeline support, and `--dry-run` protection. It is
used at the command line, in scripts or via its [API](/rc).

Users call rclone *"The Swiss army knife of cloud storage"*, and
*"Technology indistinguishable from magic"*.

Rclone really looks after your data. It preserves timestamps and
verifies checksums at all times. Transfers over limited bandwidth;
intermittent connections, or subject to quota can be restarted, from
the last good file transferred. You can
[check](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_check/) the integrity of your files. Where
possible, rclone employs server-side transfers to minimise local
bandwidth use and transfers from one provider to another without
using local disk.

Virtual backends wrap local and cloud file systems to apply
[encryption](https://rclone.org/crypt/), 
[compression](https://rclone.org/compress/),
[chunking](https://rclone.org/chunker/),
[hashing](https://rclone.org/hasher/) and
[joining](https://rclone.org/union/).

Rclone [mounts](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) any local, cloud or
virtual filesystem as a disk on Windows,
macOS, linux and FreeBSD, and also serves these over
[SFTP](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_sftp/),
[HTTP](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_http/),
[WebDAV](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_webdav/),
[FTP](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_ftp/) and
[DLNA](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_dlna/).

Rclone is mature, open source software originally inspired by rsync
and written in [Go](https://golang.org). The friendly support
community are familiar with varied use cases. Official Ubuntu, Debian,
Fedora, Brew and Chocolatey repos. include rclone. For the latest
version [downloading from rclone.org](https://rclone.org/downloads/) is recommended.

Rclone is widely used on Linux, Windows and Mac. Third party
developers create innovative backup, restore, GUI and business
process solutions using the rclone command line or API.

Rclone does the heavy lifting of communicating with cloud storage.

## What can rclone do for you? {#what}

Rclone helps you:

- Backup (and encrypt) files to cloud storage
- Restore (and decrypt) files from cloud storage
- Mirror cloud data to other cloud services or locally

# Install #

Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.

## Quickstart ##

  * [Download](https://rclone.org/downloads/) the relevant binary.
  * Extract the `rclone` executable, `rclone.exe` on Windows, from the archive.
  * Run `rclone config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.
  * Optionally configure [automatic execution](#autostart).

See below for some expanded Linux / macOS instructions.

See the [usage](https://rclone.org/docs/) docs for how to use rclone, or
run `rclone -h`.

Already installed rclone can be easily updated to the latest version
using the [rclone selfupdate](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_selfupdate/) command.

## Script installation ##

To install rclone on Linux/macOS/BSD systems, run:

    curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash

For beta installation, run:

    curl https://rclone.org/install.sh | sudo bash -s beta

Note that this script checks the version of rclone installed first and
won't re-download if not needed.

## Linux installation from precompiled binary ##

Fetch and unpack

    curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    unzip rclone-current-linux-amd64.zip
    cd rclone-*-linux-amd64

Copy binary file

    sudo cp rclone /usr/bin/
    sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/rclone
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/bin/rclone
    
Install manpage

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1
    sudo cp rclone.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/
    sudo mandb 

Run `rclone config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.

    rclone config

## macOS installation with brew ##

    brew install rclone

NOTE: This version of rclone will not support `mount` any more (see
[#5373](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/5373)). If mounting is wanted
on macOS, either install a precompiled binary or enable the relevant option
when [installing from source](#install-from-source).

## macOS installation from precompiled binary, using curl ##

To avoid problems with macOS gatekeeper enforcing the binary to be signed and
notarized it is enough to download with `curl`.

Download the latest version of rclone.

    cd && curl -O https://downloads.rclone.org/rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Unzip the download and cd to the extracted folder.

    unzip -a rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip && cd rclone-*-osx-amd64

Move rclone to your $PATH. You will be prompted for your password.

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo mv rclone /usr/local/bin/

(the `mkdir` command is safe to run, even if the directory already exists).

Remove the leftover files.

    cd .. && rm -rf rclone-*-osx-amd64 rclone-current-osx-amd64.zip

Run `rclone config` to setup. See [rclone config docs](https://rclone.org/docs/) for more details.

    rclone config

## macOS installation from precompiled binary, using a web browser ##

When downloading a binary with a web browser, the browser will set the macOS
gatekeeper quarantine attribute. Starting from Catalina, when attempting to run
`rclone`, a pop-up will appear saying:

    “rclone” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
    macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware.

The simplest fix is to run

    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine rclone

## Install with docker ##

The rclone maintains a [docker image for rclone](https://hub.docker.com/r/rclone/rclone).
These images are autobuilt by docker hub from the rclone source based
on a minimal Alpine linux image.

The `:latest` tag will always point to the latest stable release.  You
can use the `:beta` tag to get the latest build from master.  You can
also use version tags, e.g. `:1.49.1`, `:1.49` or `:1`.

```
$ docker pull rclone/rclone:latest
latest: Pulling from rclone/rclone
Digest: sha256:0e0ced72671989bb837fea8e88578b3fc48371aa45d209663683e24cfdaa0e11
...
$ docker run --rm rclone/rclone:latest version
rclone v1.49.1
- os/arch: linux/amd64
- go version: go1.12.9
```

There are a few command line options to consider when starting an rclone Docker container
from the rclone image.

- You need to mount the host rclone config dir at `/config/rclone` into the Docker
  container. Due to the fact that rclone updates tokens inside its config file, and that
  the update process involves a file rename, you need to mount the whole host rclone
  config dir, not just the single host rclone config file.

- You need to mount a host data dir at `/data` into the Docker container.

- By default, the rclone binary inside a Docker container runs with UID=0 (root).
  As a result, all files created in a run will have UID=0. If your config and data files
  reside on the host with a non-root UID:GID, you need to pass these on the container
  start command line.

- If you want to access the RC interface (either via the API or the Web UI), it is
  required to set the `--rc-addr` to `:5572` in order to connect to it from outside
  the container. An explanation about why this is necessary is present [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200808071950/https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-connection-refused/).
    * NOTE: Users running this container with the docker network set to `host` should
     probably set it to listen to localhost only, with `127.0.0.1:5572` as the value for
      `--rc-addr`

- It is possible to use `rclone mount` inside a userspace Docker container, and expose
  the resulting fuse mount to the host. The exact `docker run` options to do that might
  vary slightly between hosts. See, e.g. the discussion in this
  [thread](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/9448).

  You also need to mount the host `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` for fuse to work inside
  the container.

Here are some commands tested on an Ubuntu 18.04.3 host:

```
# config on host at ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf
# data on host at ~/data

# make sure the config is ok by listing the remotes
docker run --rm \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    rclone/rclone \
    listremotes

# perform mount inside Docker container, expose result to host
mkdir -p ~/data/mount
docker run --rm \
    --volume ~/.config/rclone:/config/rclone \
    --volume ~/data:/data:shared \
    --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
    --volume /etc/passwd:/etc/passwd:ro --volume /etc/group:/etc/group:ro \
    --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined \
    rclone/rclone \
    mount dropbox:Photos /data/mount &
ls ~/data/mount
kill %1
```

## Install from source ##

Make sure you have at least [Go](https://golang.org/) go1.14
installed.  [Download go](https://golang.org/dl/) if necessary.  The
latest release is recommended. Then

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone
go build
# If on macOS and mount is wanted, instead run: make GOTAGS=cmount
./rclone version
```

This will leave you a checked out version of rclone you can modify and
send pull requests with. If you use `make` instead of `go build` then
the rclone build will have the correct version information in it.

You can also build the latest stable rclone with:

    go get github.com/rclone/rclone

or the latest version (equivalent to the beta) with

    go get github.com/rclone/rclone@master

These will build the binary in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
(`~/go/bin/rclone` by default) after downloading the source to the go
module cache. Note - do **not** use the `-u` flag here. This causes go
to try to update the dependencies that rclone uses and sometimes these
don't work with the current version of rclone.

## Installation with Ansible ##

This can be done with [Stefan Weichinger's ansible
role](https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone).

Instructions

  1. `git clone https://github.com/stefangweichinger/ansible-rclone.git` into your local roles-directory
  2. add the role to the hosts you want rclone installed to:
    
```
    - hosts: rclone-hosts
      roles:
          - rclone
```

## Portable installation ##

As mentioned [above](https://rclone.org/install/#quickstart), rclone is single
executable (`rclone`, or `rclone.exe` on Windows) that you can download as a
zip archive and extract into a location of your choosing. When executing different
commands, it may create files in different locations, such as a configuration file
and various temporary files. By default the locations for these are according to
your operating system, e.g. configuration file in your user profile directory and
temporary files in the standard temporary directory, but you can customize all of
them, e.g. to make a completely self-contained, portable installation.

Run the [config paths](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/) command to see
the locations that rclone will use.

To override them set the corresponding options (as command-line arguments, or as
[environment variables](https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables)):
  - [--config](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file)
  - [--cache-dir](https://rclone.org/docs/#cache-dir-dir)
  - [--temp-dir](https://rclone.org/docs/#temp-dir-dir)

## Autostart

After installing and configuring rclone, as described above, you are ready to use rclone
as an interactive command line utility. If your goal is to perform *periodic* operations,
such as a regular [sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/), you will probably want
to configure your rclone command in your operating system's scheduler. If you need to
expose *service*-like features, such as [remote control](https://rclone.org/rc/),
[GUI](https://rclone.org/gui/), [serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)
or [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/), you will often want an rclone
command always running in the background, and configuring it to run in a service infrastructure
may be a better option. Below are some alternatives on how to achieve this on
different operating systems.

NOTE: Before setting up autorun it is highly recommended that you have tested your command
manually from a Command Prompt first.

### Autostart on Windows

The most relevant alternatives for autostart on Windows are:
- Run at user log on using the Startup folder
- Run at user log on, at system startup or at schedule using Task Scheduler
- Run at system startup using Windows service

#### Running in background

Rclone is a console application, so if not starting from an existing Command Prompt,
e.g. when starting rclone.exe from a shortcut, it will open a Command Prompt window.
When configuring rclone to run from task scheduler and windows service you are able
to set it to run hidden in background. From rclone version 1.54 you can also make it
run hidden from anywhere by adding option `--no-console` (it may still flash briefly
when the program starts). Since rclone normally writes information and any error
messages to the console, you must redirect this to a file to be able to see it.
Rclone has a built-in option `--log-file` for that.

Example command to run a sync in background:
```
c:\rclone\rclone.exe sync c:\files remote:/files --no-console --log-file c:\rclone\logs\sync_files.txt
```

#### User account

As mentioned in the [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_move/) documentation,
mounted drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts, not even the
account that was elevated as Administrator. By running the mount command as the
built-in `SYSTEM` user account, it will create drives accessible for everyone on
the system. Both scheduled task and Windows service can be used to achieve this.

NOTE: Remember that when rclone runs as the `SYSTEM` user, the user profile
that it sees will not be yours. This means that if you normally run rclone with
configuration file in the default location, to be able to use the same configuration
when running as the system user you must explicitely tell rclone where to find
it with the [`--config`](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option,
or else it will look in the system users profile path (`C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile`).
To test your command manually from a Command Prompt, you can run it with
the [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec)
utility from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which takes option `-s` to
execute commands as the `SYSTEM` user.

#### Start from Startup folder ###

To quickly execute an rclone command you can simply create a standard
Windows Explorer shortcut for the complete rclone command you want to run. If you
store this shortcut in the special "Startup" start-menu folder, Windows will
automatically run it at login. To open this folder in Windows Explorer,
enter path `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`,
or `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp` if you want
the command to start for *every* user that logs in.

This is the easiest approach to autostarting of rclone, but it offers no
functionality to set it to run as different user, or to set conditions or
actions on certain events. Setting up a scheduled task as described below
will often give you better results.

#### Start from Task Scheduler ###

Task Scheduler is an administrative tool built into Windows, and it can be used to
configure rclone to be started automatically in a highly configurable way, e.g.
periodically on a schedule, on user log on, or at system startup. It can run
be configured to run as the current user, or for a mount command that needs to
be available to all users it can run as the `SYSTEM` user.
For technical information, see
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page.

#### Run as service ###

For running rclone at system startup, you can create a Windows service that executes
your rclone command, as an alternative to scheduled task configured to run at startup.

##### Mount command built-in service integration ####

For mount commands, Rclone has a built-in Windows service integration via the third party
WinFsp library it uses. Registering as a regular Windows service easy, as you just have to
execute the built-in PowerShell command `New-Service` (requires administrative privileges).

Example of a PowerShell command that creates a Windows service for mounting
some `remote:/files` as drive letter `X:`, for *all* users (service will be running as the
local system account):

```
New-Service -Name Rclone -BinaryPathName 'c:\rclone\rclone.exe mount remote:/files X: --config c:\rclone\config\rclone.conf --log-file c:\rclone\logs\mount.txt'
```

The [WinFsp service infrastructure](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)
supports incorporating services for file system implementations, such as rclone,
into its own launcher service, as kind of "child services". This has the additional
advantage that it also implements a network provider that integrates into
Windows standard methods for managing network drives. This is currently not
officially supported by Rclone, but with WinFsp version 2019.3 B2 / v1.5B2 or later
it should be possible through path rewriting as described [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3340).

##### Third party service integration ####

To Windows service running any rclone command, the excellent third party utility
[NSSM](http://nssm.cc), the "Non-Sucking Service Manager", can be used.
It includes some advanced features such as adjusting process periority, defining
process environment variables, redirect to file anything written to stdout, and
customized response to different exit codes, with a GUI to configure everything from
(although it can also be used from command line ).

There are also several other alternatives. To mention one more,
[WinSW](https://github.com/winsw/winsw), "Windows Service Wrapper", is worth checking out.
It requires .NET Framework, but it is preinstalled on newer versions of Windows, and it
also provides alternative standalone distributions which includes necessary runtime (.NET 5).
WinSW is a command-line only utility, where you have to manually create an XML file with
service configuration. This may be a drawback for some, but it can also be an advantage
as it is easy to back up and re-use the configuration
settings, without having go through manual steps in a GUI. One thing to note is that
by default it does not restart the service on error, one have to explicit enable this
in the configuration file (via the "onfailure" parameter).

### Autostart on Linux

#### Start as a service

To always run rclone in background, relevant for mount commands etc,
you can use systemd to set up rclone as a system or user service. Running as a
system service ensures that it is run at startup even if the user it is running as
has no active session. Running rclone as a user service ensures that it only
starts after the configured user has logged into the system.

#### Run periodically from cron

To run a periodic command, such as a copy/sync, you can set up a cron job.

# Usage

Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage.
After [download](https://rclone.org/downloads/) and [install](/install), continue
here to learn how to use it: Initial [configuration](#configure),
what the [basic syntax](#basic-syntax) looks like, describes the
various [subcommands](#subcommands), the various [options](#options),
and more.

Configure
---------

First, you'll need to configure rclone.  As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file.
(See the [`--config`](#config-config-file) entry for how to find the config
file and choose its location.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

    rclone config

Basic syntax
-----

Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.

Its syntax is like this

    Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>

Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, e.g.
"drive:myfolder" to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.

You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.

Please use the [`-i` / `--interactive`](#interactive) flag while
learning rclone to avoid accidental data loss.

Subcommands
-----------

rclone uses a system of subcommands.  For example

    rclone ls remote:path # lists a remote
    rclone copy /local/path remote:path # copies /local/path to the remote
    rclone sync -i /local/path remote:path # syncs /local/path to the remote

# rclone config

Enter an interactive configuration session.

## Synopsis

Enter an interactive configuration session where you can setup new
remotes and manage existing ones. You may also set or remove a
password to protect your configuration.


```
rclone config [flags]
```

# rclone copy

Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.

## Synopsis


Copy the source to the destination.  Does not transfer files that are
identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification
time or MD5SUM.  Doesn't delete files from the destination.

Note that it is always the contents of the directory that is synced,
not the directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the
contents of source:path that are copied, not the directory name and
contents.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

For example

    rclone copy source:sourcepath dest:destpath

Let's say there are two files in sourcepath

    sourcepath/one.txt
    sourcepath/two.txt

This copies them to

    destpath/one.txt
    destpath/two.txt

Not to

    destpath/sourcepath/one.txt
    destpath/sourcepath/two.txt

If you are familiar with `rsync`, rclone always works as if you had
written a trailing `/` - meaning "copy the contents of this directory".
This applies to all commands and whether you are talking about the
source or destination.

See the [--no-traverse](https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.  Supplying this
option when copying a small number of files into a large destination
can speed transfers up greatly.

For example, if you have many files in /path/to/src but only a few of
them change every day, you can copy all the files which have changed
recently very efficiently like this:

    rclone copy --max-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/src remote:

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

**Note**: Use the `--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag to test without copying anything.


```
rclone copy source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after copy
  -h, --help                    help for copy
```

# rclone sync

Make source and dest identical, modifying destination only.

## Synopsis


Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination
only.  Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and
destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM.
Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files
if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below).

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

    rclone sync -i SOURCE remote:DESTINATION

Note that files in the destination won't be deleted if there were any
errors at any point.  Duplicate objects (files with the same name, on
those providers that support it) are also not yet handled.

It is always the contents of the directory that is synced, not the
directory so when source:path is a directory, it's the contents of
source:path that are copied, not the directory name and contents.  See
extended explanation in the `copy` command above if unsure.

If dest:path doesn't exist, it is created and the source:path contents
go there.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics

**Note**: Use the `rclone dedupe` command to deal with "Duplicate object/directory found in source/destination - ignoring" errors.
See [this forum post](https://forum.rclone.org/t/sync-not-clearing-duplicates/14372) for more info.


```
rclone sync source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after sync
  -h, --help                    help for sync
```

# rclone move

Move files from source to dest.

## Synopsis


Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination
directory. Rclone will error if the source and destination overlap and
the remote does not support a server-side directory move operation.

If no filters are in use and if possible this will server-side move
`source:path` into `dest:path`. After this `source:path` will no
longer exist.

Otherwise for each file in `source:path` selected by the filters (if
any) this will move it into `dest:path`.  If possible a server-side
move will be used, otherwise it will copy it (server-side if possible)
into `dest:path` then delete the original (if no errors on copy) in
`source:path`.

If you want to delete empty source directories after move, use the --delete-empty-src-dirs flag.

See the [--no-traverse](https://rclone.org/docs/#no-traverse) option for controlling
whether rclone lists the destination directory or not.  Supplying this
option when moving a small number of files into a large destination
can speed transfers up greatly.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.


```
rclone move source:path dest:path [flags]

## Options

      --create-empty-src-dirs   Create empty source dirs on destination after move
      --delete-empty-src-dirs   Delete empty source dirs after move

# rclone delete

Remove the files in path.

## Synopsis


Remove the files in path.  Unlike `purge` it obeys include/exclude
filters so can be used to selectively delete files.

`rclone delete` only deletes files but leaves the directory structure
alone. If you want to delete a directory and all of its contents use
the `purge` command.

If you supply the `--rmdirs` flag, it will remove all empty directories along with it.
You can also use the separate command `rmdir` or `rmdirs` to
delete empty directories only.

For example, to delete all files bigger than 100 MiB, you may first want to
check what would be deleted (use either):

    rclone --min-size 100M lsl remote:path
    rclone --dry-run --min-size 100M delete remote:path

Then proceed with the actual delete:

    rclone --min-size 100M delete remote:path

That reads "delete everything with a minimum size of 100 MiB", hence
delete all files bigger than 100 MiB.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.


```
rclone delete remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help     help for delete
      --rmdirs   rmdirs removes empty directories but leaves root intact
```

# rclone purge

Remove the path and all of its contents.

## Synopsis


Remove the path and all of its contents.  Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed.  Use the `delete`
command if you want to selectively delete files. To delete empty directories only,
use command `rmdir` or `rmdirs`.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

# rclone rmdir

Remove the empty directory at path.

## Synopsis


This removes empty directory given by path. Will not remove the path if it
has any objects in it, not even empty subdirectories. Use
command `rmdirs` (or `delete` with option `--rmdirs`)
to do that.

To delete a path and any objects in it, use `purge` command.


```
rclone rmdir remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for rmdir
```

# rclone check

Checks the files in the source and destination match.

## Synopsis


Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It compares
sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files which don't
match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

If you supply the `--size-only` flag, it will only compare the sizes not
the hashes as well.  Use this for a quick check.

If you supply the `--download` flag, it will download the data from
both remotes and check them against each other on the fly.  This can
be useful for remotes that don't support hashes or if you really want
to check all the data.

If you supply the `--checkfile HASH` flag with a valid hash name,
the `source:path` must point to a text file in the SUM format.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.


```
rclone check source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -C, --checkfile string        Treat source:path as a SUM file with hashes of given type
      --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
      --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
      --download                Check by downloading rather than with hash
      --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
  -h, --help                    help for check
      --match string            Report all matching files to this file
      --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
      --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
      --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote
```

# rclone ls

List the objects in the path with size and path.

## Synopsis


Lists the objects in the source path to standard output in a human
readable format with size and path. Recurses by default.

Eg

    $ rclone ls swift:bucket
        60295 bevajer5jef
        90613 canole
        94467 diwogej7
        37600 fubuwic


Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a non existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket based remotes).


```
rclone ls remote:path [flags]
```

# rclone lsd

List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.

## Synopsis


Lists the directories in the source path to standard output. Does not
recurse by default.  Use the -R flag to recurse.

This command lists the total size of the directory (if known, -1 if
not), the modification time (if known, the current time if not), the
number of objects in the directory (if known, -1 if not) and the name
of the directory, Eg

    $ rclone lsd swift:
          494000 2018-04-26 08:43:20     10000 10000files
              65 2018-04-26 08:43:20         1 1File

Or

    $ rclone lsd drive:test
              -1 2016-10-17 17:41:53        -1 1000files
              -1 2017-01-03 14:40:54        -1 2500files
              -1 2017-07-08 14:39:28        -1 4000files

If you just want the directory names use "rclone lsf --dirs-only".

# rclone dedupe

Interactively find duplicate filenames and delete/rename them.

## Synopsis



By default `dedupe` interactively finds files with duplicate
names and offers to delete all but one or rename them to be
different. This is known as deduping by name.

Deduping by name is only useful with a small group of backends (e.g. Google Drive,
Opendrive) that can have duplicate file names. It can be run on wrapping backends
(e.g. crypt) if they wrap a backend which supports duplicate file
names.

However if --by-hash is passed in then dedupe will find files with
duplicate hashes instead which will work on any backend which supports
at least one hash. This can be used to find files with duplicate
content. This is known as deduping by hash.

If deduping by name, first rclone will merge directories with the same
name.  It will do this iteratively until all the identically named
directories have been merged.

Next, if deduping by name, for every group of duplicate file names /
hashes, it will delete all but one identical files it finds without
confirmation.  This means that for most duplicated files the `dedupe` command will not be interactive.

`dedupe` considers files to be identical if they have the
same file path and the same hash. If the backend does not support hashes (e.g. crypt wrapping
Google Drive) then they will never be found to be identical. If you
use the `--size-only` flag then files will be considered
identical if they have the same size (any hash will be ignored). This
can be useful on crypt backends which do not support hashes.

Next rclone will resolve the remaining duplicates. Exactly which
action is taken depends on the dedupe mode. By default rclone will
interactively query the user for each one.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

Here is an example run.

Before - with duplicates

    $ rclone lsl drive:dupes
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:16.798000000 one.txt
      6048320 2016-03-05 16:23:11.775000000 one.txt
       564374 2016-03-05 16:23:06.731000000 one.txt

       564374 2016-03-05 16:22:52.118000000 two.txt

Now the `dedupe` session

    $ rclone dedupe drive:dupes
    2016/03/05 16:24:37 Google drive root 'dupes': Looking for duplicates using interactive mode.

      1744073 2016-03-05 16:22:38.104000000 two-3.txt

Dedupe can be run non interactively using the `--dedupe-mode` flag or by using an extra parameter with the same value

  * `--dedupe-mode interactive` - interactive as above.
  * `--dedupe-mode skip` - removes identical files then skips anything left.
  * `--dedupe-mode first` - removes identical files then keeps the first one.
  * `--dedupe-mode newest` - removes identical files then keeps the newest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode oldest` - removes identical files then keeps the oldest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode largest` - removes identical files then keeps the largest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode smallest` - removes identical files then keeps the smallest one.
  * `--dedupe-mode rename` - removes identical files then renames the rest to be different.
  * `--dedupe-mode list` - lists duplicate dirs and files only and changes nothing.

For example to rename all the identically named photos in your Google Photos directory, do

    rclone dedupe --dedupe-mode rename "drive:Google Photos"

Or

    rclone dedupe rename "drive:Google Photos"


```
rclone dedupe [mode] remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --by-hash              Find indentical hashes rather than names
      --dedupe-mode string   Dedupe mode interactive|skip|first|newest|oldest|largest|smallest|rename (default "interactive")
  -h, --help                 help for dedupe
```

# rclone about

Get quota information from the remote.

## Synopsis


`rclone about` prints quota information about a remote to standard
output. The output is typically used, free, quota and trash contents.

E.g. Typical output from `rclone about remote:` is:

    Total:   17 GiB
    Used:    7.444 GiB
    Free:    1.315 GiB
    Trashed: 100.000 MiB
    Other:   8.241 GiB

Where the fields are:

  * Total: Total size available.
  * Used: Total size used.
  * Free: Total space available to this user.
  * Trashed: Total space used by trash.
  * Other: Total amount in other storage (e.g. Gmail, Google Photos).
  * Objects: Total number of objects in the storage.

All sizes are in number of bytes.

Applying a `--full` flag to the command prints the bytes in full, e.g.

    Total:   18253611008
    Used:    7993453766
    Free:    1411001220
    Trashed: 104857602
    Other:   8849156022

A `--json` flag generates conveniently computer readable output, e.g.

    {
        "total": 18253611008,
        "used": 7993453766,
        "trashed": 104857602,
        "other": 8849156022,
        "free": 1411001220
    }

Not all backends print all fields. Information is not included if it is not
provided by a backend. Where the value is unlimited it is omitted.

Some backends does not support the `rclone about` command at all,
see complete list in [documentation](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features).


```
rclone about remote: [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --full   Full numbers instead of human-readable
  -h, --help   help for about
      --json   Format output as JSON
```

link in default browser automatically.

```
rclone authorize [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --auth-no-open-browser   Do not automatically open auth link in default browser
  -h, --help                   help for authorize
```

# rclone backend

Run a backend specific command.

## Synopsis


This runs a backend specific command. The commands themselves (except
for "help" and "features") are defined by the backends and you should
see the backend docs for definitions.

You can discover what commands a backend implements by using

    rclone backend help remote:
    rclone backend help <backendname>

You can also discover information about the backend using (see
[operations/fsinfo](https://rclone.org/rc/#operations/fsinfo) in the remote control docs
for more info).

    rclone backend features remote:

Pass options to the backend command with -o. This should be key=value or key, e.g.:

    rclone backend stats remote:path stats -o format=json -o long

Pass arguments to the backend by placing them on the end of the line

    rclone backend cleanup remote:path file1 file2 file3

Note to run these commands on a running backend then see
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend/command) in the rc docs.


```
rclone backend <command> remote:path [opts] <args> [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help                 help for backend
      --json                 Always output in JSON format
  -o, --option stringArray   Option in the form name=value or name
```

# rclone cat

Concatenates any files and sends them to stdout.

## Synopsis


rclone cat sends any files to standard output.

You can use it like this to output a single file

    rclone cat remote:path/to/file

Or like this to output any file in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone cat remote:path/to/dir

Or like this to output any .txt files in dir or its subdirectories.

    rclone --include "*.txt" cat remote:path/to/dir

Use the `--head` flag to print characters only at the start, `--tail` for
the end and `--offset` and `--count` to print a section in the middle.
Note that if offset is negative it will count from the end, so
`--offset -1 --count 1` is equivalent to `--tail 1`.


```
rclone cat remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --count int    Only print N characters (default -1)
      --discard      Discard the output instead of printing
      --head int     Only print the first N characters
  -h, --help         help for cat
      --offset int   Start printing at offset N (or from end if -ve)
      --tail int     Only print the last N characters
```

# rclone checksum

Checks the files in the source against a SUM file.

## Synopsis


Checks that hashsums of source files match the SUM file.
It compares hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc) and logs a report of files which
don't match.  It doesn't alter the file system.

If you supply the `--download` flag, it will download the data from remote
and calculate the contents hash on the fly.  This can be useful for remotes
that don't support hashes or if you really want to check all the data.

Note that hash values in the SUM file are treated as case insensitive.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.


```
rclone checksum <hash> sumfile src:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
      --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
      --download                Check by hashing the contents
      --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
  -h, --help                    help for checksum
      --match string            Report all matching files to this file
      --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
      --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
      --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote
```

# rclone config create

Create a new remote with name, type and options.

## Synopsis


Create a new remote of `name` with `type` and options.  The options
should be passed in pairs of `key` `value` or as `key=value`.

For example to make a swift remote of name myremote using auto config
you would do:

    rclone config create myremote swift env_auth true
    rclone config create myremote swift env_auth=true

So for example if you wanted to configure a Google Drive remote but
using remote authorization you would do this:

    rclone config create mydrive drive config_is_local=false

Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless `--non-interactive` is used).  Each time
that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to
affect the value taken.

If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before
putting them in the config file.

**NB** If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that
the passwords get obscured then use the `--obscure` flag, or if you
are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use
`--no-obscure`.  You can also set obscured passwords using the
`rclone config password` command.

The flag `--non-interactive` is for use by applications that wish to
configure rclone themeselves, rather than using rclone's text based
configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask
the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in
it.

This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):

```
{
    "State": "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,",
    "Option": {
        "Name": "config_is_local",
        "Help": "Use auto config?\n * Say Y if not sure\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\n",
        "Default": true,
        "Examples": [
            {
                "Value": "true",
                "Help": "Yes"
            },
            {
                "Value": "false",
                "Help": "No"
            }
        ],
        "Required": false,
        "IsPassword": false,
        "Type": "bool",
        "Exclusive": true,
    },
    "Error": "",
}
```

The format of `Option` is the same as returned by `rclone config
providers`. The question should be asked to the user and returned to
rclone as the `--result` option along with the `--state` parameter.

The keys of `Option` are used as follows:

- `Name` - name of variable - show to user
- `Help` - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be clicky.
- `Default` - default value - return this if the user just wants the default.
- `Examples` - the user should be able to choose one of these
- `Required` - the value should be non-empty
- `IsPassword` - the value is a password and should be edited as such
- `Type` - type of value, eg `bool`, `string`, `int` and others
- `Exclusive` - if set no free-form entry allowed only the `Examples`
- Irrelevant keys `Provider`, `ShortOpt`, `Hide`, `NoPrefix`, `Advanced`

If `Error` is set then it should be shown to the user at the same
time as the question.

    rclone config update name --continue --state "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,," --result "true"

Note that when using `--continue` all passwords should be passed in
the clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed
in with each invocation of `--continue`.

At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with `State` as empty string.

If `--all` is passed then rclone will ask all the config questions,
not just the post config questions. Any parameters are used as
defaults for questions as usual.

Note that `bin/config.py` in the rclone source implements this protocol
as a readable demonstration.


```
rclone config create name type [key value]* [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all               Ask the full set of config questions
      --continue          Continue the configuration process with an answer
  -h, --help              help for create
      --no-obscure        Force any passwords not to be obscured
      --non-interactive   Don't interact with user and return questions
      --obscure           Force any passwords to be obscured
      --result string     Result - use with --continue
      --state string      State - use with --continue

The `password` should be passed in in clear (unobscured).

For example to set password of a remote of name myremote you would do:

    rclone config password myremote fieldname mypassword
    rclone config password myremote fieldname=mypassword

This command is obsolete now that "config update" and "config create"
both support obscuring passwords directly.


```
rclone config password name [key value]+ [flags]
```

# rclone config update

Update options in an existing remote.

## Synopsis


Update an existing remote's options. The options should be passed in
pairs of `key` `value` or as `key=value`.

For example to update the env_auth field of a remote of name myremote
you would do:

    rclone config update myremote env_auth true
    rclone config update myremote env_auth=true

If the remote uses OAuth the token will be updated, if you don't
require this add an extra parameter thus:

    rclone config update myremote env_auth=true config_refresh_token=false

Note that if the config process would normally ask a question the
default is taken (unless `--non-interactive` is used).  Each time
that happens rclone will print or DEBUG a message saying how to
affect the value taken.

If any of the parameters passed is a password field, then rclone will
automatically obscure them if they aren't already obscured before
putting them in the config file.

**NB** If the password parameter is 22 characters or longer and
consists only of base64 characters then rclone can get confused about
whether the password is already obscured or not and put unobscured
passwords into the config file. If you want to be 100% certain that
the passwords get obscured then use the `--obscure` flag, or if you
are 100% certain you are already passing obscured passwords then use
`--no-obscure`.  You can also set obscured passwords using the
`rclone config password` command.

The flag `--non-interactive` is for use by applications that wish to
configure rclone themeselves, rather than using rclone's text based
configuration questions. If this flag is set, and rclone needs to ask
the user a question, a JSON blob will be returned with the question in
it.

This will look something like (some irrelevant detail removed):

```
{
    "State": "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,,",
    "Option": {
        "Name": "config_is_local",
        "Help": "Use auto config?\n * Say Y if not sure\n * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine\n",
        "Default": true,
        "Examples": [
            {
                "Value": "true",
                "Help": "Yes"
            },
            {
                "Value": "false",
                "Help": "No"
            }
        ],
        "Required": false,
        "IsPassword": false,
        "Type": "bool",
        "Exclusive": true,
    },
    "Error": "",
}
```

The format of `Option` is the same as returned by `rclone config
providers`. The question should be asked to the user and returned to
rclone as the `--result` option along with the `--state` parameter.

The keys of `Option` are used as follows:

- `Name` - name of variable - show to user
- `Help` - help text. Hard wrapped at 80 chars. Any URLs should be clicky.
- `Default` - default value - return this if the user just wants the default.
- `Examples` - the user should be able to choose one of these
- `Required` - the value should be non-empty
- `IsPassword` - the value is a password and should be edited as such
- `Type` - type of value, eg `bool`, `string`, `int` and others
- `Exclusive` - if set no free-form entry allowed only the `Examples`
- Irrelevant keys `Provider`, `ShortOpt`, `Hide`, `NoPrefix`, `Advanced`

If `Error` is set then it should be shown to the user at the same
time as the question.

    rclone config update name --continue --state "*oauth-islocal,teamdrive,," --result "true"

Note that when using `--continue` all passwords should be passed in
the clear (not obscured). Any default config values should be passed
in with each invocation of `--continue`.

At the end of the non interactive process, rclone will return a result
with `State` as empty string.

If `--all` is passed then rclone will ask all the config questions,
not just the post config questions. Any parameters are used as
defaults for questions as usual.

Note that `bin/config.py` in the rclone source implements this protocol
as a readable demonstration.


```
rclone config update name [key value]+ [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --all               Ask the full set of config questions
      --continue          Continue the configuration process with an answer
  -h, --help              help for update
      --no-obscure        Force any passwords not to be obscured
      --non-interactive   Don't interact with user and return questions
      --obscure           Force any passwords to be obscured
      --result string     Result - use with --continue
      --state string      State - use with --continue
```

# rclone copyto

Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.

## Synopsis


If source:path is a file or directory then it copies it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to upload single files to other than their current
name.  If the source is a directory then it acts exactly like the copy
command.

So

    rclone copyto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or
/path/to/local or C:\windows\path\if\on\windows.

This will:

    if src is file
        copy it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        copy it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see copy command for full details

This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing
by size and modification time or MD5SUM.  It doesn't delete files from
the destination.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics


```
rclone copyto source:path dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for copyto
```

See the [global flags page](https://rclone.org/flags/) for global options not listed here.

# rclone copyurl

Copy url content to dest.

## Synopsis


Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving
it in temporary storage.

Setting `--auto-filename` will cause the file name to be retrieved from
the URL (after any redirections) and used in the destination
path. With `--print-filename` in addition, the resulting file name will
be printed.

Setting `--no-clobber` will prevent overwriting file on the 
destination if there is one with the same name.

Setting `--stdout` or making the output file name `-`
will cause the output to be written to standard output.


```
rclone copyurl https://example.com dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -a, --auto-filename    Get the file name from the URL and use it for destination file path
  -h, --help             help for copyurl
      --no-clobber       Prevent overwriting file with same name
  -p, --print-filename   Print the resulting name from --auto-filename
      --stdout           Write the output to stdout rather than a file
```

# rclone cryptcheck

Cryptcheck checks the integrity of a crypted remote.

## Synopsis


rclone cryptcheck checks a remote against a crypted remote.  This is
the equivalent of running rclone check, but able to check the
checksums of the crypted remote.

For it to work the underlying remote of the cryptedremote must support
some kind of checksum.

It works by reading the nonce from each file on the cryptedremote: and
using that to encrypt each file on the remote:.  It then checks the
checksum of the underlying file on the cryptedremote: against the
checksum of the file it has just encrypted.

Use it like this

    rclone cryptcheck /path/to/files encryptedremote:path

You can use it like this also, but that will involve downloading all
the files in remote:path.

    rclone cryptcheck remote:path encryptedremote:path

After it has run it will log the status of the encryptedremote:.

If you supply the `--one-way` flag, it will only check that files in
the source match the files in the destination, not the other way
around. This means that extra files in the destination that are not in
the source will not be detected.

The `--differ`, `--missing-on-dst`, `--missing-on-src`, `--match`
and `--error` flags write paths, one per line, to the file name (or
stdout if it is `-`) supplied. What they write is described in the
help below. For example `--differ` will write all paths which are
present on both the source and destination but different.

The `--combined` flag will write a file (or stdout) which contains all
file paths with a symbol and then a space and then the path to tell
you what happened to it. These are reminiscent of diff files.

- `= path` means path was found in source and destination and was identical
- `- path` means path was missing on the source, so only in the destination
- `+ path` means path was missing on the destination, so only in the source
- `* path` means path was present in source and destination but different.
- `! path` means there was an error reading or hashing the source or dest.


```
rclone cryptcheck remote:path cryptedremote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --combined string         Make a combined report of changes to this file
      --differ string           Report all non-matching files to this file
      --error string            Report all files with errors (hashing or reading) to this file
  -h, --help                    help for cryptcheck
      --match string            Report all matching files to this file
      --missing-on-dst string   Report all files missing from the destination to this file
      --missing-on-src string   Report all files missing from the source to this file
      --one-way                 Check one way only, source files must exist on remote
```

# rclone cryptdecode

Cryptdecode returns unencrypted file names.

## Synopsis


rclone cryptdecode returns unencrypted file names when provided with
a list of encrypted file names. List limit is 10 items.

If you supply the --reverse flag, it will return encrypted file names.

use it like this

	rclone cryptdecode encryptedremote: encryptedfilename1 encryptedfilename2

	rclone cryptdecode --reverse encryptedremote: filename1 filename2

Another way to accomplish this is by using the `rclone backend encode` (or `decode`)command.
See the documentation on the `crypt` overlay for more info.


```
rclone cryptdecode encryptedremote: encryptedfilename [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help      help for cryptdecode

# rclone hashsum

Produces a hashsum file for all the objects in the path.

## Synopsis


Produces a hash file for all the objects in the path using the hash
named.  The output is in the same format as the standard
md5sum/sha1sum tool.

By default, the hash is requested from the remote.  If the hash is
not supported by the remote, no hash will be returned.  With the
download flag, the file will be downloaded from the remote and
hashed locally enabling any hash for any remote.

Run without a hash to see the list of all supported hashes, e.g.

    $ rclone hashsum
    Supported hashes are:
      * md5
      * sha1
      * whirlpool
      * crc32
      * sha256
      * dropbox
      * mailru

# rclone link

Generate public link to file/folder.

## Synopsis

rclone link will create, retrieve or remove a public link to the given
file or folder.

    rclone link remote:path/to/file
    rclone link remote:path/to/folder/
    rclone link --unlink remote:path/to/folder/
    rclone link --expire 1d remote:path/to/file

If you supply the --expire flag, it will set the expiration time
otherwise it will use the default (100 years). **Note** not all
backends support the --expire flag - if the backend doesn't support it
then the link returned won't expire.

Use the --unlink flag to remove existing public links to the file or
folder. **Note** not all backends support "--unlink" flag - those that
don't will just ignore it.

If successful, the last line of the output will contain the
link. Exact capabilities depend on the remote, but the link will
always by default be created with the least constraints – e.g. no
expiry, no password protection, accessible without account.


```
rclone link remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --expire Duration   The amount of time that the link will be valid (default off)
  -h, --help              help for link
      --unlink            Remove existing public link to file/folder

# rclone lsf

List directories and objects in remote:path formatted for parsing.

## Synopsis


List the contents of the source path (directories and objects) to
standard output in a form which is easy to parse by scripts.  By
default this will just be the names of the objects and directories,
one per line.  The directories will have a / suffix.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf swift:bucket
    bevajer5jef
    canole
    diwogej7
    ferejej3gux/
    fubuwic

Use the --format option to control what gets listed.  By default this
is just the path, but you can use these parameters to control the
output:

    p - path
    s - size
    t - modification time
    h - hash
    i - ID of object
    o - Original ID of underlying object
    m - MimeType of object if known
    e - encrypted name
    T - tier of storage if known, e.g. "Hot" or "Cool"

So if you wanted the path, size and modification time, you would use
--format "pst", or maybe --format "tsp" to put the path last.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --format "tsp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41;60295;bevajer5jef
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;90613;canole
    2016-06-25 18:55:43;94467;diwogej7
    2018-04-26 08:50:45;0;ferejej3gux/
    2016-06-25 18:55:40;37600;fubuwic

If you specify "h" in the format you will get the MD5 hash by default,
use the "--hash" flag to change which hash you want.  Note that this
can be returned as an empty string if it isn't available on the object
(and for directories), "ERROR" if there was an error reading it from
the object and "UNSUPPORTED" if that object does not support that hash
type.

For example to emulate the md5sum command you can use

    rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only .

Eg

    $ rclone lsf -R --hash MD5 --format hp --separator "  " --files-only swift:bucket 
    7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3  bevajer5jef
    cd65ac234e6fea5925974a51cdd865cc  canole
    03b5341b4f234b9d984d03ad076bae91  diwogej7
    8fd37c3810dd660778137ac3a66cc06d  fubuwic
    99713e14a4c4ff553acaf1930fad985b  gixacuh7ku

(Though "rclone md5sum ." is an easier way of typing this.)

By default the separator is ";" this can be changed with the
--separator flag.  Note that separators aren't escaped in the path so
putting it last is a good strategy.

Eg

    $ rclone lsf  --separator "," --format "tshp" swift:bucket
    2016-06-25 18:55:41,60295,7908e352297f0f530b84a756f188baa3,bevajer5jef

You can output in CSV standard format.  This will escape things in "
if they contain ,

Eg

    $ rclone lsf --csv --files-only --format ps remote:path
    test.log,22355
    test.sh,449
    "this file contains a comma, in the file name.txt",6

Note that the --absolute parameter is useful for making lists of files
to pass to an rclone copy with the --files-from-raw flag.

For example to find all the files modified within one day and copy
those only (without traversing the whole directory structure):

    rclone lsf --absolute --files-only --max-age 1d /path/to/local > new_files
    rclone copy --files-from-raw new_files /path/to/local remote:path


Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a non existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket based remotes).


```
rclone lsf remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --absolute           Put a leading / in front of path names
      --csv                Output in CSV format
  -d, --dir-slash          Append a slash to directory names (default true)
      --dirs-only          Only list directories
      --files-only         Only list files
  -F, --format string      Output format - see  help for details (default "p")
      --hash h             Use this hash when h is used in the format MD5|SHA-1|DropboxHash (default "md5")
  -h, --help               help for lsf
  -R, --recursive          Recurse into the listing
  -s, --separator string   Separator for the items in the format (default ";")
```

# rclone lsjson

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

## Synopsis

List directories and objects in the path in JSON format.

The output is an array of Items, where each Item looks like this

   {
      "Hashes" : {
         "SHA-1" : "f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f",
         "MD5" : "b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184",
         "DropboxHash" : "ecb65bb98f9d905b70458986c39fcbad7715e5f2fcc3b1f07767d7c83e2438cc"
      },
      "ID": "y2djkhiujf83u33",
      "OrigID": "UYOJVTUW00Q1RzTDA",
      "IsBucket" : false,
      "IsDir" : false,
      "MimeType" : "application/octet-stream",
      "ModTime" : "2017-05-31T16:15:57.034468261+01:00",
      "Name" : "file.txt",
      "Encrypted" : "v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338",
      "EncryptedPath" : "kja9098349023498/v0qpsdq8anpci8n929v3uu9338",
      "Path" : "full/path/goes/here/file.txt",
      "Size" : 6,
      "Tier" : "hot",
   }

If --hash is not specified the Hashes property won't be emitted. The
types of hash can be specified with the --hash-type parameter (which
may be repeated). If --hash-type is set then it implies --hash.

If --no-modtime is specified then ModTime will be blank. This can
speed things up on remotes where reading the ModTime takes an extra
request (e.g. s3, swift).

If --no-mimetype is specified then MimeType will be blank. This can
speed things up on remotes where reading the MimeType takes an extra
request (e.g. s3, swift).

If --encrypted is not specified the Encrypted won't be emitted.

If --dirs-only is not specified files in addition to directories are
returned

If --files-only is not specified directories in addition to the files
will be returned.

if --stat is set then a single JSON blob will be returned about the
item pointed to. This will return an error if the item isn't found.
However on bucket based backends (like s3, gcs, b2, azureblob etc) if
the item isn't found it will return an empty directory as it isn't
possible to tell empty directories from missing directories there.

The Path field will only show folders below the remote path being listed.
If "remote:path" contains the file "subfolder/file.txt", the Path for "file.txt"
will be "subfolder/file.txt", not "remote:path/subfolder/file.txt".
When used without --recursive the Path will always be the same as Name.

If the directory is a bucket in a bucket based backend, then
"IsBucket" will be set to true. This key won't be present unless it is
"true".

The time is in RFC3339 format with up to nanosecond precision.  The
number of decimal digits in the seconds will depend on the precision
that the remote can hold the times, so if times are accurate to the
nearest millisecond (e.g. Google Drive) then 3 digits will always be
shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57.034+01:00") whereas if the times are
accurate to the nearest second (Dropbox, Box, WebDav, etc.) no digits
will be shown ("2017-05-31T16:15:57+01:00").

The whole output can be processed as a JSON blob, or alternatively it
can be processed line by line as each item is written one to a line.

Any of the filtering options can be applied to this command.

There are several related list commands

  * `ls` to list size and path of objects only
  * `lsl` to list modification time, size and path of objects only
  * `lsd` to list directories only
  * `lsf` to list objects and directories in easy to parse format
  * `lsjson` to list objects and directories in JSON format

`ls`,`lsl`,`lsd` are designed to be human readable.
`lsf` is designed to be human and machine readable.
`lsjson` is designed to be machine readable.

Note that `ls` and `lsl` recurse by default - use `--max-depth 1` to stop the recursion.

The other list commands `lsd`,`lsf`,`lsjson` do not recurse by default - use `-R` to make them recurse.

Listing a non existent directory will produce an error except for
remotes which can't have empty directories (e.g. s3, swift, or gcs -
the bucket based remotes).

# rclone mount

Mount the remote as file system on a mountpoint.

## Synopsis


rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to
mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with
FUSE.

First set up your remote using `rclone config`.  Check it works with `rclone ls` etc.

On Linux and macOS, you can run mount in either foreground or background (aka
daemon) mode. Mount runs in foreground mode by default. Use the `--daemon` flag
to force background mode. On Windows you can run mount in foreground only,
the flag is ignored.

In background mode rclone acts as a generic Unix mount program: the main
program starts, spawns background rclone process to setup and maintain the
mount, waits until success or timeout and exits with appropriate code
(killing the child process if it fails).

On Linux/macOS/FreeBSD start the mount like this, where `/path/to/local/mount`
is an **empty** **existing** directory:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

On Windows you can start a mount in different ways. See [below](#mounting-modes-on-windows)
for details. If foreground mount is used interactively from a console window,
rclone will serve the mount and occupy the console so another window should be
used to work with the mount until rclone is interrupted e.g. by pressing Ctrl-C.

The following examples will mount to an automatically assigned drive,
to specific drive letter `X:`, to path `C:\path\parent\mount`
(where parent directory or drive must exist, and mount must **not** exist,
and is not supported when [mounting as a network drive](#mounting-modes-on-windows)), and
the last example will mount as network share `\\cloud\remote` and map it to an
automatically assigned drive:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote

When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving
a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount should be automatically stopped.

When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually:

    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually.

The size of the mounted file system will be set according to information retrieved
from the remote, the same as returned by the [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)
command. Remotes with unlimited storage may report the used size only,
then an additional 1 PiB of free space is assumed. If the remote does not
[support](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) the about feature
at all, then 1 PiB is set as both the total and the free size.

## Installing on Windows

To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to
download and install [WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).

[WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) is an open source
Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file
systems for Windows.  It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone
uses combination with [cgofuse](https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse).
Both of these packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful
during the implementation of rclone mount for Windows.

### Mounting modes on windows

Unlike other operating systems, Microsoft Windows provides a different filesystem
type for network and fixed drives. It optimises access on the assumption fixed
disk drives are fast and reliable, while network drives have relatively high latency
and less reliability. Some settings can also be differentiated between the two types,
for example that Windows Explorer should just display icons and not create preview
thumbnails for image and video files on network drives.

In most cases, rclone will mount the remote as a normal, fixed disk drive by default.
However, you can also choose to mount it as a remote network drive, often described
as a network share. If you mount an rclone remote using the default, fixed drive mode
and experience unexpected program errors, freezes or other issues, consider mounting
as a network drive instead.

When mounting as a fixed disk drive you can either mount to an unused drive letter,
or to a path representing a **non-existent** subdirectory of an **existing** parent
directory or drive. Using the special value `*` will tell rclone to
automatically assign the next available drive letter, starting with Z: and moving backward.
Examples:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files *
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files C:\path\parent\mount
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:

Option `--volname` can be used to set a custom volume name for the mounted
file system. The default is to use the remote name and path.

To mount as network drive, you can add option `--network-mode`
to your mount command. Mounting to a directory path is not supported in
this mode, it is a limitation Windows imposes on junctions, so the remote must always
be mounted to a drive letter.

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode

A volume name specified with `--volname` will be used to create the network share path.
A complete UNC path, such as `\\cloud\remote`, optionally with path
`\\cloud\remote\madeup\path`, will be used as is. Any other
string will be used as the share part, after a default prefix `\\server\`.
If no volume name is specified then `\\server\share` will be used.
You must make sure the volume name is unique when you are mounting more than one drive,
or else the mount command will fail. The share name will treated as the volume label for
the mapped drive, shown in Windows Explorer etc, while the complete
`\\server\share` will be reported as the remote UNC path by
`net use` etc, just like a normal network drive mapping.

If you specify a full network share UNC path with `--volname`, this will implicitely
set the `--network-mode` option, so the following two examples have same result:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --network-mode
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X: --volname \\server\share

You may also specify the network share UNC path as the mountpoint itself. Then rclone
will automatically assign a drive letter, same as with `*` and use that as
mountpoint, and instead use the UNC path specified as the volume name, as if it were
specified with the `--volname` option. This will also implicitely set
the `--network-mode` option. This means the following two examples have same result:

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files \\cloud\remote
    rclone mount remote:path/to/files * --volname \\cloud\remote

There is yet another way to enable network mode, and to set the share path,
and that is to pass the "native" libfuse/WinFsp option directly:
`--fuse-flag --VolumePrefix=\server\share`. Note that the path
must be with just a single backslash prefix in this case.


*Note:* In previous versions of rclone this was the only supported method.

See also [Limitations](#limitations) section below.

### Windows filesystem permissions

The FUSE emulation layer on Windows must convert between the POSIX-based
permission model used in FUSE, and the permission model used in Windows,
based on access-control lists (ACL).

The mounted filesystem will normally get three entries in its access-control list (ACL),
representing permissions for the POSIX permission scopes: Owner, group and others.
By default, the owner and group will be taken from the current user, and the built-in
group "Everyone" will be used to represent others. The user/group can be customized
with FUSE options "UserName" and "GroupName",
e.g. `-o UserName=user123 -o GroupName="Authenticated Users"`.
The permissions on each entry will be set according to [options](#options)
`--dir-perms` and `--file-perms`, which takes a value in traditional
[numeric notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions#Numeric_notation).

The default permissions corresponds to `--file-perms 0666 --dir-perms 0777`,
i.e. read and write permissions to everyone. This means you will not be able
to start any programs from the the mount. To be able to do that you must add
execute permissions, e.g. `--file-perms 0777 --dir-perms 0777` to add it
to everyone. If the program needs to write files, chances are you will have
to enable [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching) as well (see also [limitations](#limitations)).

Note that the mapping of permissions is not always trivial, and the result
you see in Windows Explorer may not be exactly like you expected.
For example, when setting a value that includes write access, this will be
mapped to individual permissions "write attributes", "write data" and "append data",
but not "write extended attributes". Windows will then show this as basic
permission "Special" instead of "Write", because "Write" includes the
"write extended attributes" permission.

If you set POSIX permissions for only allowing access to the owner, using
`--file-perms 0600 --dir-perms 0700`, the user group and the built-in "Everyone"
group will still be given some special permissions, such as "read attributes"
and "read permissions", in Windows. This is done for compatibility reasons,
e.g. to allow users without additional permissions to be able to read basic
metadata about files like in UNIX. One case that may arise is that other programs
(incorrectly) interprets this as the file being accessible by everyone. For example
an SSH client may warn about "unprotected private key file".

WinFsp 2021 (version 1.9) introduces a new FUSE option "FileSecurity",
that allows the complete specification of file security descriptors using
[SDDL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-string-format).
With this you can work around issues such as the mentioned "unprotected private key file"
by specifying `-o FileSecurity="D:P(A;;FA;;;OW)"`, for file all access (FA) to the owner (OW).

### Windows caveats

Drives created as Administrator are not visible to other accounts,
not even an account that was elevated to Administrator with the
User Account Control (UAC) feature. A result of this is that if you mount
to a drive letter from a Command Prompt run as Administrator, and then try
to access the same drive from Windows Explorer (which does not run as
Administrator), you will not be able to see the mounted drive.

If you don't need to access the drive from applications running with
administrative privileges, the easiest way around this is to always
create the mount from a non-elevated command prompt.

To make mapped drives available to the user account that created them
regardless if elevated or not, there is a special Windows setting called
[linked connections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/networking/mapped-drives-not-available-from-elevated-command#detail-to-configure-the-enablelinkedconnections-registry-entry)
that can be enabled.

It is also possible to make a drive mount available to everyone on the system,
by running the process creating it as the built-in SYSTEM account.
There are several ways to do this: One is to use the command-line
utility [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec),
from Microsoft's Sysinternals suite, which has option `-s` to start
processes as the SYSTEM account. Another alternative is to run the mount
command from a Windows Scheduled Task, or a Windows Service, configured
to run as the SYSTEM account. A third alternative is to use the
[WinFsp.Launcher infrastructure](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture)).
Note that when running rclone as another user, it will not use
the configuration file from your profile unless you tell it to
with the [`--config`](https://rclone.org/docs/#config-config-file) option.
Read more in the [install documentation](https://rclone.org/install/).

Note that mapping to a directory path, instead of a drive letter,
does not suffer from the same limitations.

## Limitations

Without the use of `--vfs-cache-mode` this can only write files
sequentially, it can only seek when reading.  This means that many
applications won't work with their files on an rclone mount without
`--vfs-cache-mode writes` or `--vfs-cache-mode full`.
See the [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching) section for more info.

The bucket based remotes (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) do not support the concept of empty directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of
the directory cache.

When `rclone mount` is invoked on Unix with `--daemon` flag, the main rclone
program will wait for the background mount to become ready or until the timeout
specified by the `--daemon-wait` flag. On Linux it can check mount status using
ProcFS so the flag in fact sets **maximum** time to wait, while the real wait
can be less. On macOS / BSD the time to wait is constant and the check is
performed only at the end. We advise you to set wait time on macOS reasonably.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

## rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy
commands cope with this with lots of retries.  However rclone mount
can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the
uploads. Look at the [VFS File Caching](#vfs-file-caching)
for solutions to make mount more reliable.

## Attribute caching

You can use the flag `--attr-timeout` to set the time the kernel caches
the attributes (size, modification time, etc.) for directory entries.

The default is `1s` which caches files just long enough to avoid
too many callbacks to rclone from the kernel.

In theory 0s should be the correct value for filesystems which can
change outside the control of the kernel. However this causes quite a
few problems such as
[rclone using too much memory](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2157),
[rclone not serving files to samba](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-1-39-vs-1-40-mount-issue/5112)
and [excessive time listing directories](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2095#issuecomment-371141147).

The kernel can cache the info about a file for the time given by
`--attr-timeout`. You may see corruption if the remote file changes
length during this window.  It will show up as either a truncated file
or a file with garbage on the end.  With `--attr-timeout 1s` this is
very unlikely but not impossible.  The higher you set `--attr-timeout`
the more likely it is.  The default setting of "1s" is the lowest
setting which mitigates the problems above.

If you set it higher (`10s` or `1m` say) then the kernel will call
back to rclone less often making it more efficient, however there is
more chance of the corruption issue above.

If files don't change on the remote outside of the control of rclone
then there is no chance of corruption.

This is the same as setting the attr_timeout option in mount.fuse.

## Filters

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.

## systemd

When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible
to use Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state
after the mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement
will see all files and folders immediately in this mode.

Note that systemd runs mount units without any environment variables including
`PATH` or `HOME`. This means that tilde (`~`) expansion will not work
and you should provide `--config` and `--cache-dir` explicitly as absolute
paths via rclone arguments.
Since mounting requires the `fusermount` program, rclone will use the fallback
PATH of `/bin:/usr/bin` in this scenario. Please ensure that `fusermount`
is present on this PATH.

## Rclone as Unix mount helper

The core Unix program `/bin/mount` normally takes the `-t FSTYPE` argument
then runs the `/sbin/mount.FSTYPE` helper program passing it mount options
as `-o key=val,...` or `--opt=...`. Automount (classic or systemd) behaves
in a similar way.

rclone by default expects GNU-style flags `--key val`. To run it as a mount
helper you should symlink rclone binary to `/sbin/mount.rclone` and optionally
`/usr/bin/rclonefs`, e.g. `ln -s /usr/bin/rclone /sbin/mount.rclone`.
rclone will detect it and translate command-line arguments appropriately.

Now you can run classic mounts like this:
```
mount sftp1:subdir /mnt/data -t rclone -o vfs_cache_mode=writes,sftp_key_file=/path/to/pem
```

or create systemd mount units:
```
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.mount
[Unit]
After=network-online.target
[Mount]
Type=rclone
What=sftp1:subdir
Where=/mnt/data
Options=rw,allow_other,args2env,vfs-cache-mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache-dir=/var/rclone
```

optionally accompanied by systemd automount unit
```
# /etc/systemd/system/mnt-data.automount
[Unit]
After=network-online.target
Before=remote-fs.target
[Automount]
Where=/mnt/data
TimeoutIdleSec=600
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

or add in `/etc/fstab` a line like
```
sftp1:subdir /mnt/data rclone rw,noauto,nofail,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,args2env,vfs_cache_mode=writes,config=/etc/rclone.conf,cache_dir=/var/cache/rclone 0 0
```

or use classic Automountd.
Remember to provide explicit `config=...,cache-dir=...` as a workaround for
mount units being run without `HOME`.

Rclone in the mount helper mode will split `-o` argument(s) by comma, replace `_`
by `-` and prepend `--` to get the command-line flags. Options containing commas
or spaces can be wrapped in single or double quotes. Any inner quotes inside outer
quotes of the same type should be doubled.

Mount option syntax includes a few extra options treated specially:

- `env.NAME=VALUE` will set an environment variable for the mount process.
  This helps with Automountd and Systemd.mount which don't allow setting
  custom environment for mount helpers.
  Typically you will use `env.HTTPS_PROXY=proxy.host:3128` or `env.HOME=/root`
- `command=cmount` can be used to run `cmount` or any other rclone command
  rather than the default `mount`.
- `args2env` will pass mount options to the mount helper running in background
  via environment variables instead of command line arguments. This allows to
  hide secrets from such commands as `ps` or `pgrep`.
- `vv...` will be transformed into appropriate `--verbose=N`
- standard mount options like `x-systemd.automount`, `_netdev`, `nosuid` and alike
  are intended only for Automountd and ignored by rclone.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone moveto

Move file or directory from source to dest.

## Synopsis


If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or
directory named dest:path.

This can be used to rename files or upload single files to other than
their existing name.  If the source is a directory then it acts exactly
like the move command.

So

    rclone moveto src dst

where src and dst are rclone paths, either remote:path or
/path/to/local or C:\windows\path\if\on\windows.

This will:

    if src is file
        move it to dst, overwriting an existing file if it exists
    if src is directory
        move it to dst, overwriting existing files if they exist
        see move command for full details

This doesn't transfer files that are identical on src and dst, testing
by size and modification time or MD5SUM.  src will be deleted on
successful transfer.

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.

**Note**: Use the `-P`/`--progress` flag to view real-time transfer statistics.

# rclone ncdu

Explore a remote with a text based user interface.

## Synopsis


This displays a text based user interface allowing the navigation of a
remote. It is most useful for answering the question - "What is using
all my disk space?".



To make the user interface it first scans the entire remote given and
builds an in memory representation.  rclone ncdu can be used during
this scanning phase and you will see it building up the directory
structure as it goes along.

Here are the keys - press '?' to toggle the help on and off

     ↑,↓ or k,j to Move
     →,l to enter
     ←,h to return
     c toggle counts
     g toggle graph
     a toggle average size in directory
     u toggle human-readable format
     n,s,C,A sort by name,size,count,average size
     d delete file/directory
     y copy current path to clipboard
     Y display current path
     ^L refresh screen
     ? to toggle help on and off
     q/ESC/c-C to quit

This an homage to the [ncdu tool](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) but for
rclone remotes.  It is missing lots of features at the moment
but is useful as it stands.

Note that it might take some time to delete big files/folders. The
UI won't respond in the meantime since the deletion is done synchronously.

# rclone obscure

Obscure password for use in the rclone config file.

## Synopsis

In the rclone config file, human readable passwords are
obscured. Obscuring them is done by encrypting them and writing them
out in base64. This is **not** a secure way of encrypting these
passwords as rclone can decrypt them - it is to prevent "eyedropping"
- namely someone seeing a password in the rclone config file by
accident.

Many equally important things (like access tokens) are not obscured in
the config file. However it is very hard to shoulder surf a 64
character hex token.

This command can also accept a password through STDIN instead of an
argument by passing a hyphen as an argument. This will use the first
line of STDIN as the password not including the trailing newline.

echo "secretpassword" | rclone obscure -

If there is no data on STDIN to read, rclone obscure will default to
obfuscating the hyphen itself.

If you want to encrypt the config file then please use config file
encryption - see [rclone config](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config/) for more
info.

# rclone rc

Run a command against a running rclone.

## Synopsis



This runs a command against a running rclone.  Use the --url flag to
specify an non default URL to connect on.  This can be either a
":port" which is taken to mean "http://localhost:port" or a
"host:port" which is taken to mean "http://host:port"

A username and password can be passed in with --user and --pass.

Note that --rc-addr, --rc-user, --rc-pass will be read also for --url,
--user, --pass.

Arguments should be passed in as parameter=value.

The result will be returned as a JSON object by default.

The --json parameter can be used to pass in a JSON blob as an input
instead of key=value arguments.  This is the only way of passing in
more complicated values.

The -o/--opt option can be used to set a key "opt" with key, value
options in the form "-o key=value" or "-o key". It can be repeated as
many times as required. This is useful for rc commands which take the
"opt" parameter which by convention is a dictionary of strings.

    -o key=value -o key2

Will place this in the "opt" value

    {"key":"value", "key2","")


The -a/--arg option can be used to set strings in the "arg" value. It
can be repeated as many times as required. This is useful for rc
commands which take the "arg" parameter which by convention is a list
of strings.

    -a value -a value2

Will place this in the "arg" value

    ["value", "value2"]

Use --loopback to connect to the rclone instance running "rclone rc".
This is very useful for testing commands without having to run an
rclone rc server, e.g.:

    rclone rc --loopback operations/about fs=/

Use "rclone rc" to see a list of all possible commands.

```

## Options

  -h, --help              help for rc
      --json string       Input JSON - use instead of key=value args
      --loopback          If set connect to this rclone instance not via HTTP
      --no-output         If set, don't output the JSON result
  -o, --opt stringArray   Option in the form name=value or name placed in the "opt" array
      --pass string       Password to use to connect to rclone remote control
      --url string        URL to connect to rclone remote control (default "http://localhost:5572/")
      --user string       Username to use to rclone remote control
```

# rclone rcat

Copies standard input to file on remote.

## Synopsis


rclone rcat reads from standard input (stdin) and copies it to a
single remote file.

    echo "hello world" | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file
    ffmpeg - | rclone rcat remote:path/to/file

If the remote file already exists, it will be overwritten.

rcat will try to upload small files in a single request, which is
usually more efficient than the streaming/chunked upload endpoints,
which use multiple requests. Exact behaviour depends on the remote.
What is considered a small file may be set through
`--streaming-upload-cutoff`. Uploading only starts after
the cutoff is reached or if the file ends before that. The data
must fit into RAM. The cutoff needs to be small enough to adhere
the limits of your remote, please see there. Generally speaking,
setting this cutoff too high will decrease your performance.

Use the |--size| flag to preallocate the file in advance at the remote end
and actually stream it, even if remote backend doesn't support streaming.

|--size| should be the exact size of the input stream in bytes. If the
size of the stream is different in length to the |--size| passed in
then the transfer will likely fail.

Note that the upload can also not be retried because the data is
not kept around until the upload succeeds. If you need to transfer
a lot of data, you're better off caching locally and then
`rclone move` it to the destination.

```

# rclone rcd

Run rclone listening to remote control commands only.

## Synopsis


This runs rclone so that it only listens to remote control commands.

This is useful if you are controlling rclone via the rc API.

If you pass in a path to a directory, rclone will serve that directory
for GET requests on the URL passed in.  It will also open the URL in
the browser when rclone is run.

See the [rc documentation](https://rclone.org/rc/) for more info on the rc flags.


```
rclone rcd <path to files to serve>* [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for rcd
```

# rclone rmdirs

Remove empty directories under the path.

## Synopsis


This recursively removes any empty directories (including directories
that only contain empty directories), that it finds under the path.
The root path itself will also be removed if it is empty, unless
you supply the `--leave-root` flag.

Use command `rmdir` to delete just the empty directory
given by path, not recurse.

This is useful for tidying up remotes that rclone has left a lot of
empty directories in. For example the `delete` command will
delete files but leave the directory structure (unless used with
option `--rmdirs`).

To delete a path and any objects in it, use `purge` command.


```
rclone rmdirs remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help         help for rmdirs
      --leave-root   Do not remove root directory if empty
```

# rclone selfupdate

Update the rclone binary.

## Synopsis


This command downloads the latest release of rclone and replaces
the currently running binary. The download is verified with a hashsum
and cryptographically signed signature.

If used without flags (or with implied `--stable` flag), this command
will install the latest stable release. However, some issues may be fixed
(or features added) only in the latest beta release. In such cases you should
run the command with the `--beta` flag, i.e. `rclone selfupdate --beta`.
You can check in advance what version would be installed by adding the
`--check` flag, then repeat the command without it when you are satisfied.

Sometimes the rclone team may recommend you a concrete beta or stable
rclone release to troubleshoot your issue or add a bleeding edge feature.
The `--version VER` flag, if given, will update to the concrete version
instead of the latest one. If you omit micro version from `VER` (for
example `1.53`), the latest matching micro version will be used.

Upon successful update rclone will print a message that contains a previous
version number. You will need it if you later decide to revert your update
for some reason. Then you'll have to note the previous version and run the
following command: `rclone selfupdate [--beta] OLDVER`.
If the old version contains only dots and digits (for example `v1.54.0`)
then it's a stable release so you won't need the `--beta` flag. Beta releases
have an additional information similar to `v1.54.0-beta.5111.06f1c0c61`.
(if you are a developer and use a locally built rclone, the version number
will end with `-DEV`, you will have to rebuild it as it obviously can't
be distributed).

If you previously installed rclone via a package manager, the package may
include local documentation or configure services. You may wish to update
with the flag `--package deb` or `--package rpm` (whichever is correct for
your OS) to update these too. This command with the default `--package zip`
will update only the rclone executable so the local manual may become
inaccurate after it.

The `rclone mount` command (https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) may
or may not support extended FUSE options depending on the build and OS.
`selfupdate` will refuse to update if the capability would be discarded.

Note: Windows forbids deletion of a currently running executable so this
command will rename the old executable to 'rclone.old.exe' upon success.

Please note that this command was not available before rclone version 1.55.
If it fails for you with the message `unknown command "selfupdate"` then
you will need to update manually following the install instructions located
at https://rclone.org/install/


```
rclone selfupdate [flags]
```

## Options

```
      --beta             Install beta release
      --check            Check for latest release, do not download
  -h, --help             help for selfupdate
      --output string    Save the downloaded binary at a given path (default: replace running binary)
      --package string   Package format: zip|deb|rpm (default: zip)
      --stable           Install stable release (this is the default)
      --version string   Install the given rclone version (default: latest)

# rclone serve dlna

Serve remote:path over DLNA

## Synopsis

rclone serve dlna is a DLNA media server for media stored in an rclone remote. Many
devices, such as the Xbox and PlayStation, can automatically discover this server in the LAN
and play audio/video from it. VLC is also supported. Service discovery uses UDP multicast
packets (SSDP) and will thus only work on LANs.

Rclone will list all files present in the remote, without filtering based on media formats or
file extensions. Additionally, there is no media transcoding support. This means that some
players might show files that they are not able to play back correctly.


## Server options

Use `--addr` to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. `--addr 1.2.3.4:8000` or `--addr :8080` to listen to all
IPs.

Use `--name` to choose the friendly server name, which is by
default "rclone (hostname)".

Use `--log-trace` in conjunction with `-vv` to enable additional debug
logging of all UPNP traffic.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone serve docker

Serve any remote on docker's volume plugin API.

## Synopsis


This command implements the Docker volume plugin API allowing docker to use
rclone as a data storage mechanism for various cloud providers.
rclone provides [docker volume plugin](/docker) based on it.

To create a docker plugin, one must create a Unix or TCP socket that Docker
will look for when you use the plugin and then it listens for commands from
docker daemon and runs the corresponding code when necessary.
Docker plugins can run as a managed plugin under control of the docker daemon
or as an independent native service. For testing, you can just run it directly
from the command line, for example:
```
sudo rclone serve docker --base-dir /tmp/rclone-volumes --socket-addr localhost:8787 -vv
```

Running `rclone serve docker` will create the said socket, listening for
commands from Docker to create the necessary Volumes. Normally you need not
give the `--socket-addr` flag. The API will listen on the unix domain socket
at `/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock`. In the example above rclone will create
a TCP socket and a small file `/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec` containing
the socket address. We use `sudo` because both paths are writeable only by
the root user.

If you later decide to change listening socket, the docker daemon must be
restarted to reconnect to `/run/docker/plugins/rclone.sock`
or parse new `/etc/docker/plugins/rclone.spec`. Until you restart, any
volume related docker commands will timeout trying to access the old socket.
Running directly is supported on **Linux only**, not on Windows or MacOS.
This is not a problem with managed plugin mode described in details
in the [full documentation](https://rclone.org/docker).

The command will create volume mounts under the path given by `--base-dir`
(by default `/var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone` available only to root)
and maintain the JSON formatted file `docker-plugin.state` in the rclone cache
directory with book-keeping records of created and mounted volumes.

All mount and VFS options are submitted by the docker daemon via API, but
you can also provide defaults on the command line as well as set path to the
config file and cache directory or adjust logging verbosity.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## SEE ALSO

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve ftp

Serve remote:path over FTP.

## Synopsis


rclone serve ftp implements a basic ftp server to serve the
remote over FTP protocol. This can be viewed with a ftp client
or you can make a remote of type ftp to read and write it.

## Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.

## SEE ALSO

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve http

Serve the remote over HTTP.

## Synopsis

rclone serve http implements a basic web server to serve the remote
over HTTP.  This can be viewed in a web browser or you can make a
remote of type http read from it.

You can use the filter flags (e.g. --include, --exclude) to control what
is served.

The server will log errors.  Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.  Use --stats to
control the stats printing.

## Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, eg --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone",
--baseurl "/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated
identically.

### SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.  If you
wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply --client-ca also.

--cert should be a either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  --key should be the PEM encoded
private key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.
--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

Use --salt to change the password hashing salt from the default.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

# rclone serve restic

Serve the remote for restic's REST API.

## Synopsis

rclone serve restic implements restic's REST backend API
over HTTP.  This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage
mechanism for cloud providers that restic does not support directly.

[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a command line program for doing
backups.

The server will log errors.  Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.  Use --stats to
control the stats printing.

## Setting up rclone for use by restic ###

First [set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider](https://rclone.org/docs/#configure).

Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
"rclone lsd remote:".  You may have called the remote something other
than "remote:" - just substitute whatever you called it in the
following instructions.

Now start the rclone restic server

    rclone serve restic -v remote:backup

Where you can replace "backup" in the above by whatever path in the
remote you wish to use.

By default this will serve on "localhost:8080" you can change this
with use of the "--addr" flag.

You might wish to start this server on boot.

Adding --cache-objects=false will cause rclone to stop caching objects
returned from the List call. Caching is normally desirable as it speeds
up downloading objects, saves transactions and uses very little memory.

## Setting up restic to use rclone ###

Now you can [follow the restic
instructions](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.

Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.

For the example above you will want to use "http://localhost:8080/" as
the URL for the REST server.

For example:

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
    $ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    $ restic init
    created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
    the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
    irrecoverably lost.
    $ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
    scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
    scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
    [0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:00
    snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved

### Multiple repositories ####

Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.  Do
this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.  Note that
these **must** end with /.  Eg

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
    # backup user1 stuff
    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
    # backup user2 stuff

### Private repositories ####

The "--private-repos" flag can be used to limit users to repositories starting
with a path of `/<username>/`.

## Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone",
--baseurl "/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated
identically.

--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

### SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.  If you
wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply --client-ca also.

--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  --key should be the PEM encoded
private key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

# rclone serve sftp

Serve the remote over SFTP.

## Synopsis

rclone serve sftp implements an SFTP server to serve the remote
over SFTP.  This can be used with an SFTP client or you can make a
remote of type sftp to use with it.

You can use the filter flags (e.g. --include, --exclude) to control what
is served.

The server will log errors.  Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.  Use --stats to
control the stats printing.

You must provide some means of authentication, either with --user/--pass,
an authorized keys file (specify location with --authorized-keys - the
default is the same as ssh), an --auth-proxy, or set the --no-auth flag for no
authentication when logging in.

Note that this also implements a small number of shell commands so
that it can provide md5sum/sha1sum/df information for the rclone sftp
backend.  This means that is can support SHA1SUMs, MD5SUMs and the
about command when paired with the rclone sftp backend.

If you don't supply a host --key then rclone will generate rsa, ecdsa
and ed25519 variants, and cache them for later use in rclone's cache
directory (see "rclone help flags cache-dir") in the "serve-sftp"
directory.

By default the server binds to localhost:2022 - if you want it to be
reachable externally then supply "--addr :2022" for example.

Note that the default of "--vfs-cache-mode off" is fine for the rclone
sftp backend, but it may not be with other SFTP clients.

If --stdio is specified, rclone will serve SFTP over stdio, which can
be used with sshd via ~/.ssh/authorized_keys, for example:

    restrict,command="rclone serve sftp --stdio ./photos" ssh-rsa ...


## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.  


```

## SEE ALSO

* [rclone serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/)	 - Serve a remote over a protocol.

# rclone serve webdav

Serve remote:path over webdav.

## Synopsis


rclone serve webdav implements a basic webdav server to serve the
remote over HTTP via the webdav protocol. This can be viewed with a
webdav client, through a web browser, or you can make a remote of
type webdav to read and write it.

## Webdav options

### --etag-hash 

This controls the ETag header.  Without this flag the ETag will be
based on the ModTime and Size of the object.

If this flag is set to "auto" then rclone will choose the first
supported hash on the backend or you can use a named hash such as
"MD5" or "SHA-1".

Use "rclone hashsum" to see the full list.


## Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone",
--baseurl "/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated
identically.

--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

### SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.  If you
wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply --client-ca also.

--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  --key should be the PEM encoded
private key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.

## VFS - Virtual File System

This command uses the VFS layer. This adapts the cloud storage objects
that rclone uses into something which looks much more like a disk
filing system.

Cloud storage objects have lots of properties which aren't like disk
files - you can't extend them or write to the middle of them, so the
VFS layer has to deal with that. Because there is no one right way of
doing this there are various options explained below.

The VFS layer also implements a directory cache - this caches info
about files and directories (but not the data) in memory.

## VFS Directory Cache

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can control how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made through the mount will appear immediately or
invalidate the cache.

    --dir-cache-time duration   Time to cache directory entries for (default 5m0s)
    --poll-interval duration    Time to wait between polling for changes. Must be smaller than dir-cache-time. Only on supported remotes. Set to 0 to disable (default 1m0s)

However, changes made directly on the cloud storage by the web
interface or a different copy of rclone will only be picked up once
the directory cache expires if the backend configured does not support
polling for changes. If the backend supports polling, changes will be
picked up within the polling interval.

You can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for it to flush all
directory caches, regardless of how old they are.  Assuming only one
rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
rclone rc to flush the whole directory cache:

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Or individual files or directories:

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=path/to/file dir=path/to/dir

## VFS File Buffering

The `--buffer-size` flag determines the amount of memory,
that will be used to buffer data in advance.

Each open file will try to keep the specified amount of data in memory
at all times. The buffered data is bound to one open file and won't be
shared.

This flag is a upper limit for the used memory per open file.  The
buffer will only use memory for data that is downloaded but not not
yet read. If the buffer is empty, only a small amount of memory will
be used.

The maximum memory used by rclone for buffering can be up to
`--buffer-size * open files`.

## VFS File Caching

These flags control the VFS file caching options. File caching is
necessary to make the VFS layer appear compatible with a normal file
system. It can be disabled at the cost of some compatibility.

For example you'll need to enable VFS caching if you want to read and
write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache is separate from the cache backend and you may
find that you need one or the other or both.

    --cache-dir string                   Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-mode CacheMode           Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default off)
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-max-size SizeSuffix      Max total size of objects in the cache (default off)
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects (default 1m0s)
    --vfs-write-back duration            Time to writeback files after last use when using cache (default 5s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed and if they haven't been accessed for `--vfs-write-back`
seconds. If rclone is quit or dies with files that haven't been
uploaded, these will be uploaded next time rclone is run with the same
flags.

If using `--vfs-cache-max-size` note that the cache may exceed this size
for two reasons.  Firstly because it is only checked every
`--vfs-cache-poll-interval`.  Secondly because open files cannot be
evicted from the cache.

You **should not** run two copies of rclone using the same VFS cache
with the same or overlapping remotes if using `--vfs-cache-mode > off`.
This can potentially cause data corruption if you do. You can work
around this by giving each rclone its own cache hierarchy with
`--cache-dir`. You don't need to worry about this if the remotes in
use don't overlap.

### --vfs-cache-mode off

In this mode (the default) the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode minimal

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disk.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

### --vfs-cache-mode writes

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried at exponentially increasing
intervals up to 1 minute.

### --vfs-cache-mode full

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk. When
data is read from the remote this is buffered to disk as well.

In this mode the files in the cache will be sparse files and rclone
will keep track of which bits of the files it has downloaded.

So if an application only reads the starts of each file, then rclone
will only buffer the start of the file. These files will appear to be
their full size in the cache, but they will be sparse files with only
the data that has been downloaded present in them.

This mode should support all normal file system operations and is
otherwise identical to `--vfs-cache-mode` writes.

When reading a file rclone will read `--buffer-size` plus
`--vfs-read-ahead` bytes ahead.  The `--buffer-size` is buffered in memory
whereas the `--vfs-read-ahead` is buffered on disk.

When using this mode it is recommended that `--buffer-size` is not set
too large and `--vfs-read-ahead` is set large if required.

**IMPORTANT** not all file systems support sparse files. In particular
FAT/exFAT do not. Rclone will perform very badly if the cache
directory is on a filesystem which doesn't support sparse files and it
will log an ERROR message if one is detected.

## VFS Chunked Reading

When rclone reads files from a remote it reads them in chunks. This
means that rather than requesting the whole file rclone reads the
chunk specified.  This can reduce the used download quota for some
remotes by requesting only chunks from the remote that are actually
read, at the cost of an increased number of requests.

These flags control the chunking:

    --vfs-read-chunk-size SizeSuffix        Read the source objects in chunks (default 128M)
    --vfs-read-chunk-size-limit SizeSuffix  Max chunk doubling size (default off)

Rclone will start reading a chunk of size `--vfs-read-chunk-size`,
and then double the size for each read. When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit` is
specified, and greater than `--vfs-read-chunk-size`, the chunk size for each
open file will get doubled only until the specified value is reached. If the
value is "off", which is the default, the limit is disabled and the chunk size
will grow indefinitely.

With `--vfs-read-chunk-size 100M` and `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 0`
the following parts will be downloaded: 0-100M, 100M-200M, 200M-300M, 300M-400M and so on.
When `--vfs-read-chunk-size-limit 500M` is specified, the result would be
0-100M, 100M-300M, 300M-700M, 700M-1200M, 1200M-1700M and so on.

Setting `--vfs-read-chunk-size` to `0` or "off" disables chunked reading.

## VFS Performance

These flags may be used to enable/disable features of the VFS for
performance or other reasons. See also the [chunked reading](#vfs-chunked-reading)
feature.

In particular S3 and Swift benefit hugely from the `--no-modtime` flag
(or use `--use-server-modtime` for a slightly different effect) as each
read of the modification time takes a transaction.

    --no-checksum     Don't compare checksums on up/download.
    --no-modtime      Don't read/write the modification time (can speed things up).
    --no-seek         Don't allow seeking in files.
    --read-only       Mount read-only.

Sometimes rclone is delivered reads or writes out of order. Rather
than seeking rclone will wait a short time for the in sequence read or
write to come in. These flags only come into effect when not using an
on disk cache file.

    --vfs-read-wait duration   Time to wait for in-sequence read before seeking (default 20ms)
    --vfs-write-wait duration  Time to wait for in-sequence write before giving error (default 1s)

When using VFS write caching (`--vfs-cache-mode` with value writes or full),
the global flag `--transfers` can be set to adjust the number of parallel uploads of
modified files from cache (the related global flag `--checkers` have no effect on mount).

    --transfers int  Number of file transfers to run in parallel (default 4)

## VFS Case Sensitivity

Linux file systems are case-sensitive: two files can differ only
by case, and the exact case must be used when opening a file.

File systems in modern Windows are case-insensitive but case-preserving:
although existing files can be opened using any case, the exact case used
to create the file is preserved and available for programs to query.
It is not allowed for two files in the same directory to differ only by case.

Usually file systems on macOS are case-insensitive. It is possible to make macOS
file systems case-sensitive but that is not the default.

The `--vfs-case-insensitive` mount flag controls how rclone handles these
two cases. If its value is "false", rclone passes file names to the mounted
file system as-is. If the flag is "true" (or appears without a value on
command line), rclone may perform a "fixup" as explained below.

The user may specify a file name to open/delete/rename/etc with a case
different than what is stored on mounted file system. If an argument refers
to an existing file with exactly the same name, then the case of the existing
file on the disk will be used. However, if a file name with exactly the same
name is not found but a name differing only by case exists, rclone will
transparently fixup the name. This fixup happens only when an existing file
is requested. Case sensitivity of file names created anew by rclone is
controlled by an underlying mounted file system.

Note that case sensitivity of the operating system running rclone (the target)
may differ from case sensitivity of a file system mounted by rclone (the source).
The flag controls whether "fixup" is performed to satisfy the target.

If the flag is not provided on the command line, then its default value depends
on the operating system where rclone runs: "true" on Windows and macOS, "false"
otherwise. If the flag is provided without a value, then it is "true".

## Alternate report of used bytes

Some backends, most notably S3, do not report the amount of bytes used.
If you need this information to be available when running `df` on the
filesystem, then pass the flag `--vfs-used-is-size` to rclone.
With this flag set, instead of relying on the backend to report this
information, rclone will scan the whole remote similar to `rclone size`
and compute the total used space itself.

_WARNING._ Contrary to `rclone size`, this flag ignores filters so that the
result is accurate. However, this is very inefficient and may cost lots of API
calls resulting in extra charges. Use it as a last resort and only with caching.

## Auth Proxy

If you supply the parameter `--auth-proxy /path/to/program` then
rclone will use that program to generate backends on the fly which
then are used to authenticate incoming requests.  This uses a simple
JSON based protocol with input on STDIN and output on STDOUT.

**PLEASE NOTE:** `--auth-proxy` and `--authorized-keys` cannot be used
together, if `--auth-proxy` is set the authorized keys option will be
ignored.

There is an example program
[bin/test_proxy.py](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/blob/master/test_proxy.py)
in the rclone source code.

The program's job is to take a `user` and `pass` on the input and turn
those into the config for a backend on STDOUT in JSON format.  This
config will have any default parameters for the backend added, but it
won't use configuration from environment variables or command line
options - it is the job of the proxy program to make a complete
config.

This config generated must have this extra parameter
- `_root` - root to use for the backend

And it may have this parameter
- `_obscure` - comma separated strings for parameters to obscure

If password authentication was used by the client, input to the proxy
process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword"
}
```

If public-key authentication was used by the client, input to the
proxy process (on STDIN) would look similar to this:

```
{
	"user": "me",
	"public_key": "AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDuwESFdAe14hVS6omeyX7edc...JQdf"
}
```

And as an example return this on STDOUT

```
{
	"type": "sftp",
	"_root": "",
	"_obscure": "pass",
	"user": "me",
	"pass": "mypassword",
	"host": "sftp.example.com"
}
```

This would mean that an SFTP backend would be created on the fly for
the `user` and `pass`/`public_key` returned in the output to the host given.  Note
that since `_obscure` is set to `pass`, rclone will obscure the `pass`
parameter before creating the backend (which is required for sftp
backends).

The program can manipulate the supplied `user` in any way, for example
to make proxy to many different sftp backends, you could make the
`user` be `user@example.com` and then set the `host` to `example.com`
in the output and the user to `user`. For security you'd probably want
to restrict the `host` to a limited list.

Note that an internal cache is keyed on `user` so only use that for
configuration, don't use `pass` or `public_key`.  This also means that if a user's
password or public-key is changed the cache will need to expire (which takes 5 mins)
before it takes effect.

This can be used to build general purpose proxies to any kind of
backend that rclone supports.

# rclone settier

Changes storage class/tier of objects in remote.

## Synopsis


rclone settier changes storage tier or class at remote if supported.
Few cloud storage services provides different storage classes on objects,
for example AWS S3 and Glacier, Azure Blob storage - Hot, Cool and Archive,
Google Cloud Storage, Regional Storage, Nearline, Coldline etc.

Note that, certain tier changes make objects not available to access immediately.
For example tiering to archive in azure blob storage makes objects in frozen state,
user can restore by setting tier to Hot/Cool, similarly S3 to Glacier makes object
inaccessible.true

You can use it to tier single object

    rclone settier Cool remote:path/file

Or use rclone filters to set tier on only specific files

	rclone --include "*.txt" settier Hot remote:path/dir

Or just provide remote directory and all files in directory will be tiered

    rclone settier tier remote:path/dir


```
rclone settier tier remote:path [flags]
```

# rclone touch

Create new file or change file modification time.

## Synopsis


Set the modification time on file(s) as specified by remote:path to
have the current time.

If remote:path does not exist then a zero sized file will be created,
unless `--no-create` or `--recursive` is provided.

If `--recursive` is used then recursively sets the modification
time on all existing files that is found under the path. Filters are supported,
and you can test with the `--dry-run` or the `--interactive` flag.

If `--timestamp` is used then sets the modification time to that
time instead of the current time. Times may be specified as one of:

- 'YYMMDD' - e.g. 17.10.30
- 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS' - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05
- 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSS' - e.g. 2006-01-02T15:04:05.123456789

Note that value of `--timestamp` is in UTC. If you want local time
then add the `--localtime` flag.


```
rclone touch remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help               help for touch
      --localtime          Use localtime for timestamp, not UTC
  -C, --no-create          Do not create the file if it does not exist (implied with --recursive)
  -R, --recursive          Recursively touch all files
  -t, --timestamp string   Use specified time instead of the current time of day
```

# rclone tree

List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.

## Synopsis


rclone tree lists the contents of a remote in a similar way to the
unix tree command.

For example

    $ rclone tree remote:path
    /
    ├── file1
    ├── file2
    ├── file3
    └── subdir
        ├── file4
        └── file5
    
    1 directories, 5 files

You can use any of the filtering options with the tree command (e.g.
--include and --exclude).  You can also use --fast-list.

The tree command has many options for controlling the listing which
are compatible with the tree command.  Note that not all of them have
short options as they conflict with rclone's short options.


```
rclone tree remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -a, --all             All files are listed (list . files too)
  -C, --color           Turn colorization on always
  -d, --dirs-only       List directories only
      --dirsfirst       List directories before files (-U disables)
      --full-path       Print the full path prefix for each file
  -h, --help            help for tree
      --human           Print the size in a more human readable way.
      --level int       Descend only level directories deep
  -D, --modtime         Print the date of last modification.
      --noindent        Don't print indentation lines
      --noreport        Turn off file/directory count at end of tree listing
  -o, --output string   Output to file instead of stdout
  -p, --protections     Print the protections for each file.
  -Q, --quote           Quote filenames with double quotes.
  -s, --size            Print the size in bytes of each file.
      --sort string     Select sort: name,version,size,mtime,ctime
      --sort-ctime      Sort files by last status change time
  -t, --sort-modtime    Sort files by last modification time
  -r, --sort-reverse    Reverse the order of the sort
  -U, --unsorted        Leave files unsorted
      --version         Sort files alphanumerically by version
```

Copying single files
--------------------

rclone normally syncs or copies directories.  However, if the source
remote points to a file, rclone will just copy that file.  The
destination remote must point to a directory - rclone will give the
error `Failed to create file system for "remote:file": is a file not a
directory` if it isn't.

For example, suppose you have a remote with a file in called
`test.jpg`, then you could copy just that file like this

    rclone copy remote:test.jpg /tmp/download

The file `test.jpg` will be placed inside `/tmp/download`.

This is equivalent to specifying

    rclone copy --files-from /tmp/files remote: /tmp/download

Where `/tmp/files` contains the single line

    test.jpg

It is recommended to use `copy` when copying individual files, not `sync`.
They have pretty much the same effect but `copy` will use a lot less
memory.

Syntax of remote paths
----------------------

The syntax of the paths passed to the rclone command are as follows.

### /path/to/dir

This refers to the local file system.

On Windows `\` may be used instead of `/` in local paths **only**,
non local paths must use `/`. See [local filesystem](https://rclone.org/local/#paths-on-windows)
documentation for more about Windows-specific paths.

These paths needn't start with a leading `/` - if they don't then they
will be relative to the current directory.

### remote:path/to/dir

This refers to a directory `path/to/dir` on `remote:` as defined in
the config file (configured with `rclone config`).

### remote:/path/to/dir

On most backends this is refers to the same directory as
`remote:path/to/dir` and that format should be preferred.  On a very
small number of remotes (FTP, SFTP, Dropbox for business) this will
refer to a different directory.  On these, paths without a leading `/`
will refer to your "home" directory and paths with a leading `/` will
refer to the root.

### :backend:path/to/dir

This is an advanced form for creating remotes on the fly.  `backend`
should be the name or prefix of a backend (the `type` in the config
file) and all the configuration for the backend should be provided on
the command line (or in environment variables).

Here are some examples:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://pub.rclone.org :http:

To list all the directories in the root of `https://pub.rclone.org/`.

    rclone lsf --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir

To list files and directories in `https://example.com/path/to/dir/`

    rclone copy --http-url https://example.com :http:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories in `https://example.com/path/to/dir` to `/tmp/dir`.

    rclone copy --sftp-host example.com :sftp:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

To copy files and directories from `example.com` in the relative
directory `path/to/dir` to `/tmp/dir` using sftp.

### Connection strings {#connection-strings}

The above examples can also be written using a connection string
syntax, so instead of providing the arguments as command line
parameters `--http-url https://pub.rclone.org` they are provided as
part of the remote specification as a kind of connection string.

    rclone lsd ":http,url='https://pub.rclone.org':"
    rclone lsf ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir"
    rclone copy ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir" /tmp/dir
    rclone copy :sftp,host=example.com:path/to/dir /tmp/dir

These can apply to modify existing remotes as well as create new
remotes with the on the fly syntax. This example is equivalent to
adding the `--drive-shared-with-me` parameter to the remote `gdrive:`.

    rclone lsf "gdrive,shared_with_me:path/to/dir"

The major advantage to using the connection string style syntax is
that it only applies to the remote, not to all the remotes of that
type of the command line. A common confusion is this attempt to copy a
file shared on google drive to the normal drive which **does not
work** because the `--drive-shared-with-me` flag applies to both the
source and the destination.

    rclone copy --drive-shared-with-me gdrive:shared-file.txt gdrive:

However using the connection string syntax, this does work.

    rclone copy "gdrive,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt" gdrive:

Note that the connection string only affects the options of the immediate 
backend. If for example gdriveCrypt is a crypt based on gdrive, then the 
following command **will not work** as intended, because 
`shared_with_me` is ignored by the crypt backend:

    rclone copy "gdriveCrypt,shared_with_me:shared-file.txt" gdriveCrypt:

The connection strings have the following syntax

    remote,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir
    :backend,parameter=value,parameter2=value2:path/to/dir

If the `parameter` has a `:` or `,` then it must be placed in quotes `"` or
`'`, so

    remote,parameter="colon:value",parameter2="comma,value":path/to/dir
    :backend,parameter='colon:value',parameter2='comma,value':path/to/dir

If a quoted value needs to include that quote, then it should be
doubled, so

    remote,parameter="with""quote",parameter2='with''quote':path/to/dir

This will make `parameter` be `with"quote` and `parameter2` be
`with'quote`.

If you leave off the `=parameter` then rclone will substitute `=true`
which works very well with flags. For example to use s3 configured in
the environment you could use:

    rclone lsd :s3,env_auth:

Which is equivalent to

    rclone lsd :s3,env_auth=true:

Note that on the command line you might need to surround these
connection strings with `"` or `'` to stop the shell interpreting any
special characters within them.

If you are a shell master then you'll know which strings are OK and
which aren't, but if you aren't sure then enclose them in `"` and use
`'` as the inside quote. This syntax works on all OSes.

    rclone copy ":http,url='https://example.com':path/to/dir" /tmp/dir

On Linux/macOS some characters are still interpreted inside `"`
strings in the shell (notably `\` and `$` and `"`) so if your strings
contain those you can swap the roles of `"` and `'` thus. (This syntax
does not work on Windows.)

    rclone copy ':http,url="https://example.com":path/to/dir' /tmp/dir

#### Connection strings, config and logging

If you supply extra configuration to a backend by command line flag,
environment variable or connection string then rclone will add a
suffix based on the hash of the config to the name of the remote, eg

    rclone -vv lsf --s3-chunk-size 20M s3:

Has the log message

    DEBUG : s3: detected overridden config - adding "{Srj1p}" suffix to name

This is so rclone can tell the modified remote apart from the
unmodified remote when caching the backends.

This should only be noticeable in the logs.

This means that on the fly backends such as

    rclone -vv lsf :s3,env_auth:

Will get their own names

    DEBUG : :s3: detected overridden config - adding "{YTu53}" suffix to name

### Valid remote names

Remote names are case sensitive, and must adhere to the following rules:
 - May only contain `0`-`9`, `A`-`Z`, `a`-`z`, `_`, `-` and space.
 - May not start with `-` or space.

Quoting and the shell
---------------------

When you are typing commands to your computer you are using something
called the command line shell.  This interprets various characters in
an OS specific way.

Here are some gotchas which may help users unfamiliar with the shell rules

### Linux / OSX ###

If your names have spaces or shell metacharacters (e.g. `*`, `?`, `$`,
`'`, `"`, etc.) then you must quote them.  Use single quotes `'` by default.

    rclone copy 'Important files?' remote:backup

If you want to send a `'` you will need to use `"`, e.g.

    rclone copy "O'Reilly Reviews" remote:backup

The rules for quoting metacharacters are complicated and if you want
the full details you'll have to consult the manual page for your
shell.

### Windows ###

If your names have spaces in you need to put them in `"`, e.g.

    rclone copy "E:\folder name\folder name\folder name" remote:backup

If you are using the root directory on its own then don't quote it
(see [#464](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/464) for why), e.g.

    rclone copy E:\ remote:backup

Copying files or directories with `:` in the names
--------------------------------------------------

rclone uses `:` to mark a remote name.  This is, however, a valid
filename component in non-Windows OSes.  The remote name parser will
only search for a `:` up to the first `/` so if you need to act on a
file or directory like this then use the full path starting with a
`/`, or use `./` as a current directory prefix.

So to sync a directory called `sync:me` to a remote called `remote:` use

    rclone sync -i ./sync:me remote:path

or

    rclone sync -i /full/path/to/sync:me remote:path

Server Side Copy
----------------

Most remotes (but not all - see [the
overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)) support server-side copy.

This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't
download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.

Eg

    rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket

Will copy the contents of `oldbucket` to `newbucket` without
downloading and re-uploading.

Remotes which don't support server-side copy **will** download and
re-upload in this case.

Server side copies are used with `sync` and `copy` and will be
identified in the log when using the `-v` flag.  The `move` command
may also use them if remote doesn't support server-side move directly.
This is done by issuing a server-side copy then a delete which is much
quicker than a download and re-upload.

Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.

This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, e.g.

    rclone sync -i remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
    rclone sync -i /path/to/files remote:current-backup

Options
-------

Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

Options that take parameters can have the values passed in two ways,
`--option=value` or `--option value`. However boolean (true/false)
options behave slightly differently to the other options in that
`--boolean` sets the option to `true` and the absence of the flag sets
it to `false`.  It is also possible to specify `--boolean=false` or
`--boolean=true`.  Note that `--boolean false` is not valid - this is
parsed as `--boolean` and the `false` is parsed as an extra command
line argument for rclone.

Options which use TIME use the go time parser.  A duration string is a
possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional
fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid
time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Options which use SIZE use KiB (multiples of 1024 bytes) by default.
However, a suffix of `B` for Byte, `K` for KiB, `M` for MiB,
`G` for GiB, `T` for TiB and `P` for PiB may be used. These are
the binary units, e.g. 1, 2\*\*10, 2\*\*20, 2\*\*30 respectively.

### --backup-dir=DIR ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted are moved in their original hierarchy into this
directory.

If `--suffix` is set, then the moved files will have the suffix added
to them.  If there is a file with the same path (after the suffix has
been added) in DIR, then it will be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must
use the same remote as the destination of the sync.  The backup
directory must not overlap the destination directory.

For example

    rclone sync -i /path/to/local remote:current --backup-dir remote:old

will sync `/path/to/local` to `remote:current`, but for any files
which would have been updated or deleted will be stored in
`remote:old`.

If running rclone from a script you might want to use today's date as
the directory name passed to `--backup-dir` to store the old files, or
you might want to pass `--suffix` with today's date.

See `--compare-dest` and `--copy-dest`.

### --bind string ###

Local address to bind to for outgoing connections.  This can be an
IPv4 address (1.2.3.4), an IPv6 address (1234::789A) or host name.  If
the host name doesn't resolve or resolves to more than one IP address
it will give an error.

### --bwlimit=BANDWIDTH_SPEC ###

This option controls the bandwidth limit. For example

    --bwlimit 10M
    
would mean limit the upload and download bandwidth to 10 MiB/s.
**NB** this is **bytes** per second not **bits** per second. To use a
single limit, specify the desired bandwidth in KiB/s, or use a
suffix B|K|M|G|T|P. The default is `0` which means to not limit bandwidth.

The upload and download bandwidth can be specified seperately, as
`--bwlimit UP:DOWN`, so

    --bwlimit 10M:100k

would mean limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s and the download
bandwidth to 100 KiB/s. Either limit can be "off" meaning no limit, so
to just limit the upload bandwidth you would use

    --bwlimit 10M:off

this would limit the upload bandwidth to 10 MiB/s but the download
bandwidth would be unlimited.

When specified as above the bandwidth limits last for the duration of
run of the rclone binary.

It is also possible to specify a "timetable" of limits, which will
cause certain limits to be applied at certain times. To specify a
timetable, format your entries as `WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH
WEEKDAY-HH:MM,BANDWIDTH...` where: `WEEKDAY` is optional element.

- `BANDWIDTH` can be a single number, e.g.`100k` or a pair of numbers
for upload:download, e.g.`10M:1M`.
- `WEEKDAY` can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3
  characters. It is optional.
- `HH:MM` is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

An example of a typical timetable to avoid link saturation during daytime
working hours could be:

`--bwlimit "08:00,512k 12:00,10M 13:00,512k 18:00,30M 23:00,off"`

In this example, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s
at 8am every day. At noon, it will rise to 10 MiB/s, and drop back
to 512 KiB/sec at 1pm. At 6pm, the bandwidth limit will be set to
30 MiB/s, and at 11pm it will be completely disabled (full speed).
Anything between 11pm and 8am will remain unlimited.

An example of timetable with `WEEKDAY` could be:

`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 Fri-23:59,10M Sat-10:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"`

It means that, the transfer bandwidth will be set to 512 KiB/s on
Monday. It will rise to 10 MiB/s before the end of Friday. At 10:00
on Saturday it will be set to 1 MiB/s. From 20:00 on Sunday it will
be unlimited.

Timeslots without `WEEKDAY` are extended to the whole week. So this
example:

`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512 12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"`

Is equivalent to this:

`--bwlimit "Mon-00:00,512Mon-12:00,1M Tue-12:00,1M Wed-12:00,1M Thu-12:00,1M Fri-12:00,1M Sat-12:00,1M Sun-12:00,1M Sun-20:00,off"`

Bandwidth limit apply to the data transfer for all backends. For most
backends the directory listing bandwidth is also included (exceptions
being the non HTTP backends, `ftp`, `sftp` and `tardigrade`).

Note that the units are **Byte/s**, not **bit/s**. Typically
connections are measured in bit/s - to convert divide by 8. For
example, let's say you have a 10 Mbit/s connection and you wish rclone
to use half of it - 5 Mbit/s. This is 5/8 = 0.625 MiB/s so you would
use a `--bwlimit 0.625M` parameter for rclone.

On Unix systems (Linux, macOS, …) the bandwidth limiter can be toggled by
sending a `SIGUSR2` signal to rclone. This allows to remove the limitations
of a long running rclone transfer and to restore it back to the value specified
with `--bwlimit` quickly when needed. Assuming there is only one rclone instance
running, you can toggle the limiter like this:

    kill -SIGUSR2 $(pidof rclone)

If you configure rclone with a [remote control](/rc) then you can use
change the bwlimit dynamically:

    rclone rc core/bwlimit rate=1M

### --bwlimit-file=BANDWIDTH_SPEC ###

This option controls per file bandwidth limit. For the options see the
`--bwlimit` flag.

For example use this to allow no transfers to be faster than 1 MiB/s

    --bwlimit-file 1M

This can be used in conjunction with `--bwlimit`.

Note that if a schedule is provided the file will use the schedule in
effect at the start of the transfer.

### --buffer-size=SIZE ###

Use this sized buffer to speed up file transfers.  Each `--transfer`
will use this much memory for buffering.

When using `mount` or `cmount` each open file descriptor will use this much
memory for buffering.
See the [mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-buffering) documentation for more details.

Set to `0` to disable the buffering for the minimum memory usage.

Note that the memory allocation of the buffers is influenced by the
[--use-mmap](#use-mmap) flag.

### --cache-dir=DIR ###

Specify the directory rclone will use for caching, to override
the default.

Default value is depending on operating system:
- Windows `%LocalAppData%\rclone`, if `LocalAppData` is defined.
- macOS `$HOME/Library/Caches/rclone` if `HOME` is defined.
- Unix `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rclone` if `XDG_CACHE_HOME` is defined, else `$HOME/.cache/rclone` if `HOME` is defined.
- Fallback (on all OS) to `$TMPDIR/rclone`, where `TMPDIR` is the value from [--temp-dir](#temp-dir-dir).

You can use the [config paths](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/)
command to see the current value.

Cache directory is heavily used by the [VFS File Caching](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#vfs-file-caching)
mount feature, but also by [serve](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve/), [GUI](/gui) and other parts of rclone.

### --check-first ###

If this flag is set then in a `sync`, `copy` or `move`, rclone will do
all the checks to see whether files need to be transferred before
doing any of the transfers. Normally rclone would start running
transfers as soon as possible.

This flag can be useful on IO limited systems where transfers
interfere with checking.

It can also be useful to ensure perfect ordering when using
`--order-by`.

Using this flag can use more memory as it effectively sets
`--max-backlog` to infinite. This means that all the info on the
objects to transfer is held in memory before the transfers start.

### --checkers=N ###

The number of checkers to run in parallel.  Checkers do the equality
checking of files during a sync.  For some storage systems (e.g. S3,
Swift, Dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are
run in parallel.

The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.

### -c, --checksum ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
the file hash and size to determine if files are equal.

This is useful when the remote doesn't support setting modified time
and a more accurate sync is desired than just checking the file size.

This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
same hash type on the object, e.g. Drive and Swift. For details of which
remotes support which hash type see the table in the [overview
section](https://rclone.org/overview/).

Eg `rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket` would run much
quicker than without the `--checksum` flag.

When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.

### --compare-dest=DIR ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` DIR is checked in addition to the 
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that 
file is NOT copied from source. This is useful to copy just files that 
have changed since the last backup.

You must use the same remote as the destination of the sync.  The 
compare directory must not overlap the destination directory.

See `--copy-dest` and `--backup-dir`.

### --config=CONFIG_FILE ###

Specify the location of the rclone configuration file, to override
the default. E.g. `rclone config --config="rclone.conf"`.

The exact default is a bit complex to describe, due to changes
introduced through different versions of rclone while preserving
backwards compatibility, but in most cases it is as simple as:

 - `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf` on Windows
 - `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` on other

The complete logic is as follows: Rclone will look for an existing
configuration file in any of the following locations, in priority order:

  1. `rclone.conf` (in program directory, where rclone executable is)
  2. `%APPDATA%/rclone/rclone.conf` (only on Windows)
  3. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rclone/rclone.conf` (on all systems, including Windows)
  4. `~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` (see below for explanation of ~ symbol)
  5. `~/.rclone.conf`

If no existing configuration file is found, then a new one will be created
in the following location:

- On Windows: Location 2 listed above, except in the unlikely event
  that `APPDATA` is not defined, then location 4 is used instead.
- On Unix: Location 3 if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is defined, else location 4.
- Fallback to location 5 (on all OS), when the rclone directory cannot be
  created, but if also a home directory was not found then path
  `.rclone.conf` relative to current working directory will be used as
  a final resort.

The `~` symbol in paths above represent the home directory of the current user
on any OS, and the value is defined as following:

  - On Windows: `%HOME%` if defined, else `%USERPROFILE%`, or else `%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%`.
  - On Unix: `$HOME` if defined, else by looking up current user in OS-specific user database
    (e.g. passwd file), or else use the result from shell command `cd && pwd`.

If you run `rclone config file` you will see where the default
location is for you.

The fact that an existing file `rclone.conf` in the same directory
as the rclone executable is always preferred, means that it is easy
to run in "portable" mode by downloading rclone executable to a
writable directory and then create an empty file `rclone.conf` in the
same directory.

If the location is set to empty string `""` or path to a file
with name `notfound`, or the os null device represented by value `NUL` on
Windows and `/dev/null` on Unix systems, then rclone will keep the
config file in memory only.

The file format is basic [INI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Format):
Sections of text, led by a `[section]` header and followed by
`key=value` entries on separate lines. In rclone each remote is
represented by its own section, where the section name defines the
name of the remote. Options are specified as the `key=value` entries,
where the key is the option name without the `--backend-` prefix,
in lowercase and with `_` instead of `-`. E.g. option `--mega-hard-delete`
corresponds to key `hard_delete`. Only backend options can be specified.
A special, and required, key `type` identifies the [storage system](https://rclone.org/overview/),
where the value is the internal lowercase name as returned by command
`rclone help backends`. Comments are indicated by `;` or `#` at the
beginning of a line.

Example:

    [megaremote]
    type = mega
    user = you@example.com
    pass = PDPcQVVjVtzFY-GTdDFozqBhTdsPg3qH

Note that passwords are in [obscured](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/)
form. Also, many storage systems uses token-based authentication instead
of passwords, and this requires additional steps. It is easier, and safer,
to use the interactive command `rclone config` instead of manually
editing the configuration file.

The configuration file will typically contain login information, and
should therefore have restricted permissions so that only the current user
can read it. Rclone tries to ensure this when it writes the file.
You may also choose to [encrypt](#configuration-encryption) the file.

When token-based authentication are used, the configuration file
must be writable, because rclone needs to update the tokens inside it.

### --contimeout=TIME ###

Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which
looks like `5s` for 5 seconds, `10m` for 10 minutes, or `3h30m`.

The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.  It is
`1m` by default.

### --copy-dest=DIR ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` DIR is checked in addition to the 
destination for files. If a file identical to the source is found that 
file is server-side copied from DIR to the destination. This is useful 
for incremental backup.

The remote in use must support server-side copy and you must
use the same remote as the destination of the sync.  The compare
directory must not overlap the destination directory.

See `--compare-dest` and `--backup-dir`.

### --dedupe-mode MODE ###

Mode to run dedupe command in.  One of `interactive`, `skip`, `first`, `newest`, `oldest`, `rename`.  The default is `interactive`.  See the dedupe command for more information as to what these options mean.

### --disable FEATURE,FEATURE,... ###

This disables a comma separated list of optional features. For example
to disable server-side move and server-side copy use:

    --disable move,copy

The features can be put in any case.

To see a list of which features can be disabled use:

    --disable help

See the overview [features](https://rclone.org/overview/#features) and
[optional features](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features) to get an idea of
which feature does what.

This flag can be useful for debugging and in exceptional circumstances
(e.g. Google Drive limiting the total volume of Server Side Copies to
100 GiB/day).

### --dscp VALUE ###

Specify a DSCP value or name to use in connections. This could help QoS
system to identify traffic class. BE, EF, DF, LE, CSx and AFxx are allowed.

See the description of [differentiated services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services) to get an idea of
this field. Setting this to 1 (LE) to identify the flow to SCAVENGER class
can avoid occupying too much bandwidth in a network with DiffServ support ([RFC 8622](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8622)).

For example, if you configured QoS on router to handle LE properly. Running:
```
rclone copy --dscp LE from:/from to:/to
```
would make the priority lower than usual internet flows.

This option has no effect on Windows (see [golang/go#42728](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42728)).

### -n, --dry-run ###

Do a trial run with no permanent changes.  Use this to see what rclone
would do without actually doing it.  Useful when setting up the `sync`
command which deletes files in the destination.

### --expect-continue-timeout=TIME ###

This specifies the amount of time to wait for a server's first
response headers after fully writing the request headers if the
request has an "Expect: 100-continue" header. Not all backends support
using this.

Zero means no timeout and causes the body to be sent immediately,
without waiting for the server to approve.  This time does not include
the time to send the request header.

The default is `1s`.  Set to `0` to disable.

### --error-on-no-transfer ###

By default, rclone will exit with return code 0 if there were no errors.

This option allows rclone to return exit code 9 if no files were transferred
between the source and destination. This allows using rclone in scripts, and
triggering follow-on actions if data was copied, or skipping if not.

NB: Enabling this option turns a usually non-fatal error into a potentially
fatal one - please check and adjust your scripts accordingly!

### --fs-cache-expire-duration=TIME

When using rclone via the API rclone caches created remotes for 5
minutes by default in the "fs cache". This means that if you do
repeated actions on the same remote then rclone won't have to build it
again from scratch, which makes it more efficient.

This flag sets the time that the remotes are cached for. If you set it
to `0` (or negative) then rclone won't cache the remotes at all.

Note that if you use some flags, eg `--backup-dir` and if this is set
to `0` rclone may build two remotes (one for the source or destination
and one for the `--backup-dir` where it may have only built one
before.

### --fs-cache-expire-interval=TIME

This controls how often rclone checks for cached remotes to expire.
See the `--fs-cache-expire-duration` documentation above for more
info. The default is 60s, set to 0 to disable expiry.

### --header ###

Add an HTTP header for all transactions. The flag can be repeated to
add multiple headers.

If you want to add headers only for uploads use `--header-upload` and
if you want to add headers only for downloads use `--header-download`.

This flag is supported for all HTTP based backends even those not
supported by `--header-upload` and `--header-download` so may be used
as a workaround for those with care.

```
rclone ls remote:test --header "X-Rclone: Foo" --header "X-LetMeIn: Yes"
```

### --header-download ###

Add an HTTP header for all download transactions. The flag can be repeated to
add multiple headers.

```
rclone sync -i s3:test/src ~/dst --header-download "X-Amz-Meta-Test: Foo" --header-download "X-Amz-Meta-Test2: Bar"
```

See the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59) for
currently supported backends.

### --header-upload ###

Add an HTTP header for all upload transactions. The flag can be repeated to add
multiple headers.

```
rclone sync -i ~/src s3:test/dst --header-upload "Content-Disposition: attachment; filename='cool.html'" --header-upload "X-Amz-Meta-Test: FooBar"
```

See the GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/59) for
currently supported backends.

### --human-readable ###

Rclone commands output values for sizes (e.g. number of bytes) and
counts (e.g. number of files) either as *raw* numbers, or
in *human-readable* format.

In human-readable format the values are scaled to larger units, indicated with
a suffix shown after the value, and rounded to three decimals. Rclone consistently
uses binary units (powers of 2) for sizes and decimal units (powers of 10) for counts.
The unit prefix for size is according to IEC standard notation, e.g. `Ki` for kibi.
Used with byte unit, `1 KiB` means 1024 Byte. In list type of output, only the
unit prefix appended to the value (e.g. `9.762Ki`), while in more textual output
the full unit is shown (e.g. `9.762 KiB`). For counts the SI standard notation is
used, e.g. prefix `k` for kilo. Used with file counts, `1k` means 1000 files.

The various [list](commands/rclone_ls/) commands output raw numbers by default.
Option `--human-readable` will make them output values in human-readable format
instead (with the short unit prefix).

The [about](commands/rclone_about/) command outputs human-readable by default,
with a command-specific option `--full` to output the raw numbers instead.

Command [size](commands/rclone_size/) outputs both human-readable and raw numbers
in the same output.

The [tree](commands/rclone_tree/) command also considers `--human-readable`, but
it will not use the exact same notation as the other commands: It rounds to one
decimal, and uses single letter suffix, e.g. `K` instead of `Ki`. The reason for
this is that it relies on an external library.

The interactive command [ncdu](commands/rclone_ncdu/) shows human-readable by
default, and responds to key `u` for toggling human-readable format.

### --ignore-case-sync ###

Using this option will cause rclone to ignore the case of the files 
when synchronizing so files will not be copied/synced when the
existing filenames are the same, even if the casing is different.

### --ignore-checksum ###

Normally rclone will check that the checksums of transferred files
match, and give an error "corrupted on transfer" if they don't.

You can use this option to skip that check.  You should only use it if
you have had the "corrupted on transfer" error message and you are
sure you might want to transfer potentially corrupted data.

### --ignore-existing ###

Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files
that exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.

While this isn't a generally recommended option, it can be useful
in cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot
correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.

When performing a `move`/`moveto` command, this flag will leave skipped
files in the source location unchanged when a file with the same name
exists on the destination.

### --ignore-size ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the modification time.  If `--checksum` is set then it only
checks the checksum.

It will also cause rclone to skip verifying the sizes are the same
after transfer.

This can be useful for transferring files to and from OneDrive which
occasionally misreports the size of image files (see
[#399](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/399) for more info).

### -I, --ignore-times ###

Using this option will cause rclone to unconditionally upload all
files regardless of the state of files on the destination.

Normally rclone would skip any files that have the same
modification time and are the same size (or have the same checksum if
using `--checksum`).

### --immutable ###

Treat source and destination files as immutable and disallow
modification.

With this option set, files will be created and deleted as requested,
but existing files will never be updated.  If an existing file does
not match between the source and destination, rclone will give the error
`Source and destination exist but do not match: immutable file modified`.

Note that only commands which transfer files (e.g. `sync`, `copy`,
`move`) are affected by this behavior, and only modification is
disallowed.  Files may still be deleted explicitly (e.g. `delete`,
`purge`) or implicitly (e.g. `sync`, `move`).  Use `copy --immutable`
if it is desired to avoid deletion as well as modification.

This can be useful as an additional layer of protection for immutable
or append-only data sets (notably backup archives), where modification
implies corruption and should not be propagated.

### -i / --interactive {#interactive}

This flag can be used to tell rclone that you wish a manual
confirmation before destructive operations.

It is **recommended** that you use this flag while learning rclone
especially with `rclone sync`.

For example

```
$ rclone delete -i /tmp/dir
rclone: delete "important-file.txt"?
y) Yes, this is OK (default)
n) No, skip this
s) Skip all delete operations with no more questions
!) Do all delete operations with no more questions
q) Exit rclone now.
y/n/s/!/q> n
```

The options mean

- `y`: **Yes**, this operation should go ahead. You can also press Return
  for this to happen. You'll be asked every time unless you choose `s`
  or `!`.
- `n`: **No**, do not do this operation. You'll be asked every time unless
  you choose `s` or `!`.
- `s`: **Skip** all the following operations of this type with no more
  questions. This takes effect until rclone exits. If there are any
  different kind of operations you'll be prompted for them.
- `!`: **Do all** the following operations with no more
  questions. Useful if you've decided that you don't mind rclone doing
  that kind of operation. This takes effect until rclone exits . If
  there are any different kind of operations you'll be prompted for
  them.
- `q`: **Quit** rclone now, just in case!

### --leave-root ####

During rmdirs it will not remove root directory, even if it's empty.

### --log-file=FILE ###

Log all of rclone's output to FILE.  This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in
combination with the `-v` flag.  See the [Logging section](#logging)
for more info.

If FILE exists then rclone will append to it.

Note that if you are using the `logrotate` program to manage rclone's
logs, then you should use the `copytruncate` option as rclone doesn't
have a signal to rotate logs.

### --log-format LIST ###

Comma separated list of log format options. Accepted options are `date`, `time`, `microseconds`, `pid`, `longfile`, `shortfile`, `UTC`. Any other keywords will be silently ignored. `pid` will tag log messages with process identifier which useful with `rclone mount --daemon`. Other accepted options are explained in the [go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/log#pkg-constants). The default log format is "`date`,`time`".

### --log-level LEVEL ###

This sets the log level for rclone.  The default log level is `NOTICE`.

`DEBUG` is equivalent to `-vv`. It outputs lots of debug info - useful
for bug reports and really finding out what rclone is doing.

`INFO` is equivalent to `-v`. It outputs information about each transfer
and prints stats once a minute by default.

`NOTICE` is the default log level if no logging flags are supplied. It
outputs very little when things are working normally. It outputs
warnings and significant events.

`ERROR` is equivalent to `-q`. It only outputs error messages.

### --use-json-log ###

This switches the log format to JSON for rclone. The fields of json log 
are level, msg, source, time.

### --low-level-retries NUMBER ###

This controls the number of low level retries rclone does.

A low level retry is used to retry a failing operation - typically one
HTTP request.  This might be uploading a chunk of a big file for
example.  You will see low level retries in the log with the `-v`
flag.

This shouldn't need to be changed from the default in normal operations.
However, if you get a lot of low level retries you may wish
to reduce the value so rclone moves on to a high level retry (see the
`--retries` flag) quicker.

Disable low level retries with `--low-level-retries 1`.

### --max-backlog=N ###

This is the maximum allowable backlog of files in a sync/copy/move
queued for being checked or transferred.

This can be set arbitrarily large.  It will only use memory when the
queue is in use.  Note that it will use in the order of N KiB of memory
when the backlog is in use.

Setting this large allows rclone to calculate how many files are
pending more accurately, give a more accurate estimated finish
time and make `--order-by` work more accurately.

Setting this small will make rclone more synchronous to the listings
of the remote which may be desirable.

Setting this to a negative number will make the backlog as large as
possible.

### --max-delete=N ###

This tells rclone not to delete more than N files.  If that limit is
exceeded then a fatal error will be generated and rclone will stop the
operation in progress.

### --max-depth=N ###

This modifies the recursion depth for all the commands except purge.

So if you do `rclone --max-depth 1 ls remote:path` you will see only
the files in the top level directory.  Using `--max-depth 2` means you
will see all the files in first two directory levels and so on.

For historical reasons the `lsd` command defaults to using a
`--max-depth` of 1 - you can override this with the command line flag.

You can use this command to disable recursion (with `--max-depth 1`).

Note that if you use this with `sync` and `--delete-excluded` the
files not recursed through are considered excluded and will be deleted
on the destination.  Test first with `--dry-run` if you are not sure
what will happen.

### --max-duration=TIME ###

Rclone will stop scheduling new transfers when it has run for the
duration specified.

Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached any existing transfers will complete.

Rclone won't exit with an error if the transfer limit is reached.

### --max-transfer=SIZE ###

Rclone will stop transferring when it has reached the size specified.
Defaults to off.

When the limit is reached all transfers will stop immediately.

Rclone will exit with exit code 8 if the transfer limit is reached.

### --cutoff-mode=hard|soft|cautious ###

This modifies the behavior of `--max-transfer`
Defaults to `--cutoff-mode=hard`.

Specifying `--cutoff-mode=hard` will stop transferring immediately
when Rclone reaches the limit.

Specifying `--cutoff-mode=soft` will stop starting new transfers
when Rclone reaches the limit.

Specifying `--cutoff-mode=cautious` will try to prevent Rclone
from reaching the limit.

### --modify-window=TIME ###

When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.

The default is `1ns` unless this is overridden by a remote.  For
example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
`1s` by default.

This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.

### --multi-thread-cutoff=SIZE ###

When downloading files to the local backend above this size, rclone
will use multiple threads to download the file (default 250M).

Rclone preallocates the file (using `fallocate(FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE)`
on unix or `NTSetInformationFile` on Windows both of which takes no
time) then each thread writes directly into the file at the correct
place.  This means that rclone won't create fragmented or sparse files
and there won't be any assembly time at the end of the transfer.

The number of threads used to download is controlled by
`--multi-thread-streams`.

Use `-vv` if you wish to see info about the threads.

This will work with the `sync`/`copy`/`move` commands and friends
`copyto`/`moveto`.  Multi thread downloads will be used with `rclone
mount` and `rclone serve` if `--vfs-cache-mode` is set to `writes` or
above.

**NB** that this **only** works for a local destination but will work
with any source.

**NB** that multi thread copies are disabled for local to local copies
as they are faster without unless `--multi-thread-streams` is set
explicitly.

**NB** on Windows using multi-thread downloads will cause the
resulting files to be [sparse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file).
Use `--local-no-sparse` to disable sparse files (which may cause long
delays at the start of downloads) or disable multi-thread downloads
with `--multi-thread-streams 0`

### --multi-thread-streams=N ###

When using multi thread downloads (see above `--multi-thread-cutoff`)
this sets the maximum number of streams to use.  Set to `0` to disable
multi thread downloads (Default 4).

Exactly how many streams rclone uses for the download depends on the
size of the file. To calculate the number of download streams Rclone
divides the size of the file by the `--multi-thread-cutoff` and rounds
up, up to the maximum set with `--multi-thread-streams`.

So if `--multi-thread-cutoff 250M` and `--multi-thread-streams 4` are
in effect (the defaults):

- 0..250 MiB files will be downloaded with 1 stream
- 250..500 MiB files will be downloaded with 2 streams
- 500..750 MiB files will be downloaded with 3 streams
- 750+ MiB files will be downloaded with 4 streams

### --no-check-dest ###

The `--no-check-dest` can be used with `move` or `copy` and it causes
rclone not to check the destination at all when copying files.

This means that:

- the destination is not listed minimising the API calls
- files are always transferred
- this can cause duplicates on remotes which allow it (e.g. Google Drive)
- `--retries 1` is recommended otherwise you'll transfer everything again on a retry

This flag is useful to minimise the transactions if you know that none
of the files are on the destination.

This is a specialized flag which should be ignored by most users!

### --no-gzip-encoding ###

Don't set `Accept-Encoding: gzip`.  This means that rclone won't ask
the server for compressed files automatically. Useful if you've set
the server to return files with `Content-Encoding: gzip` but you
uploaded compressed files.

There is no need to set this in normal operation, and doing so will
decrease the network transfer efficiency of rclone.

### --no-traverse ###

The `--no-traverse` flag controls whether the destination file system
is traversed when using the `copy` or `move` commands.
`--no-traverse` is not compatible with `sync` and will be ignored if
you supply it with `sync`.

If you are only copying a small number of files (or are filtering most
of the files) and/or have a large number of files on the destination
then `--no-traverse` will stop rclone listing the destination and save
time.

However, if you are copying a large number of files, especially if you
are doing a copy where lots of the files under consideration haven't
changed and won't need copying then you shouldn't use `--no-traverse`.

See [rclone copy](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_copy/) for an example of how to use it.

### --no-unicode-normalization ###

Don't normalize unicode characters in filenames during the sync routine.

Sometimes, an operating system will store filenames containing unicode
parts in their decomposed form (particularly macOS). Some cloud storage
systems will then recompose the unicode, resulting in duplicate files if
the data is ever copied back to a local filesystem.

Using this flag will disable that functionality, treating each unicode
character as unique. For example, by default é and é will be normalized
into the same character. With `--no-unicode-normalization` they will be
treated as unique characters.

### --no-update-modtime ###

When using this flag, rclone won't update modification times of remote
files if they are incorrect as it would normally.

This can be used if the remote is being synced with another tool also
(e.g. the Google Drive client).

### --order-by string ###

The `--order-by` flag controls the order in which files in the backlog
are processed in `rclone sync`, `rclone copy` and `rclone move`.

The order by string is constructed like this.  The first part
describes what aspect is being measured:

- `size` - order by the size of the files
- `name` - order by the full path of the files
- `modtime` - order by the modification date of the files

This can have a modifier appended with a comma:

- `ascending` or `asc` - order so that the smallest (or oldest) is processed first
- `descending` or `desc` - order so that the largest (or newest) is processed first
- `mixed` - order so that the smallest is processed first for some threads and the largest for others

If the modifier is `mixed` then it can have an optional percentage
(which defaults to `50`), e.g. `size,mixed,25` which means that 25% of
the threads should be taking the smallest items and 75% the
largest. The threads which take the smallest first will always take
the smallest first and likewise the largest first threads. The `mixed`
mode can be useful to minimise the transfer time when you are
transferring a mixture of large and small files - the large files are
guaranteed upload threads and bandwidth and the small files will be
processed continuously.

If no modifier is supplied then the order is `ascending`.

For example

- `--order-by size,desc` - send the largest files first
- `--order-by modtime,ascending` - send the oldest files first
- `--order-by name` - send the files with alphabetically by path first

If the `--order-by` flag is not supplied or it is supplied with an
empty string then the default ordering will be used which is as
scanned.  With `--checkers 1` this is mostly alphabetical, however
with the default `--checkers 8` it is somewhat random.

#### Limitations

The `--order-by` flag does not do a separate pass over the data.  This
means that it may transfer some files out of the order specified if

- there are no files in the backlog or the source has not been fully scanned yet
- there are more than [--max-backlog](#max-backlog-n) files in the backlog

Rclone will do its best to transfer the best file it has so in
practice this should not cause a problem.  Think of `--order-by` as
being more of a best efforts flag rather than a perfect ordering.

If you want perfect ordering then you will need to specify
[--check-first](#check-first) which will find all the files which need
transferring first before transferring any.

### --password-command SpaceSepList ###

This flag supplies a program which should supply the config password
when run. This is an alternative to rclone prompting for the password
or setting the `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` variable.

The argument to this should be a command with a space separated list
of arguments. If one of the arguments has a space in then enclose it
in `"`, if you want a literal `"` in an argument then enclose the
argument in `"` and double the `"`. See [CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv)
for more info.

Eg

    --password-command echo hello
    --password-command echo "hello with space"
    --password-command echo "hello with ""quotes"" and space"

See the [Configuration Encryption](#configuration-encryption) for more info.

See a [Windows PowerShell example on the Wiki](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/wiki/Windows-Powershell-use-rclone-password-command-for-Config-file-password).

### -P, --progress ###

This flag makes rclone update the stats in a static block in the
terminal providing a realtime overview of the transfer.

Any log messages will scroll above the static block.  Log messages
will push the static block down to the bottom of the terminal where it
will stay.

Normally this is updated every 500mS but this period can be overridden
with the `--stats` flag.

This can be used with the `--stats-one-line` flag for a simpler
display.

Note: On Windows until [this bug](https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm/issues/26)
is fixed all non-ASCII characters will be replaced with `.` when
`--progress` is in use.

### --progress-terminal-title ###

This flag, when used with `-P/--progress`, will print the string `ETA: %s`
to the terminal title.

### -q, --quiet ###

This flag will limit rclone's output to error messages only.

### --refresh-times ###

The `--refresh-times` flag can be used to update modification times of
existing files when they are out of sync on backends which don't
support hashes.

This is useful if you uploaded files with the incorrect timestamps and
you now wish to correct them.

This flag is **only** useful for destinations which don't support
hashes (e.g. `crypt`).

This can be used any of the sync commands `sync`, `copy` or `move`.

To use this flag you will need to be doing a modification time sync
(so not using `--size-only` or `--checksum`). The flag will have no
effect when using `--size-only` or `--checksum`.

If this flag is used when rclone comes to upload a file it will check
to see if there is an existing file on the destination. If this file
matches the source with size (and checksum if available) but has a
differing timestamp then instead of re-uploading it, rclone will
update the timestamp on the destination file. If the checksum does not
match rclone will upload the new file. If the checksum is absent (e.g.
on a `crypt` backend) then rclone will update the timestamp.

Note that some remotes can't set the modification time without
re-uploading the file so this flag is less useful on them.

Normally if you are doing a modification time sync rclone will update
modification times without `--refresh-times` provided that the remote
supports checksums **and** the checksums match on the file. However if the
checksums are absent then rclone will upload the file rather than
setting the timestamp as this is the safe behaviour.

### --retries int ###

Retry the entire sync if it fails this many times it fails (default 3).

Some remotes can be unreliable and a few retries help pick up the
files which didn't get transferred because of errors.

Disable retries with `--retries 1`.

### --retries-sleep=TIME ###

This sets the interval between each retry specified by `--retries` 

The default is `0`. Use `0` to disable.

### --size-only ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the size.

This can be useful transferring files from Dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.

### --stats=TIME ###

Commands which transfer data (`sync`, `copy`, `copyto`, `move`,
`moveto`) will print data transfer stats at regular intervals to show
their progress.

This sets the interval.

The default is `1m`. Use `0` to disable.

If you set the stats interval then all commands can show stats.  This
can be useful when running other commands, `check` or `mount` for
example.

Stats are logged at `INFO` level by default which means they won't
show at default log level `NOTICE`.  Use `--stats-log-level NOTICE` or
`-v` to make them show.  See the [Logging section](#logging) for more
info on log levels.

Note that on macOS you can send a SIGINFO (which is normally ctrl-T in
the terminal) to make the stats print immediately.

### --stats-file-name-length integer ###
By default, the `--stats` output will truncate file names and paths longer 
than 40 characters.  This is equivalent to providing 
`--stats-file-name-length 40`. Use `--stats-file-name-length 0` to disable 
any truncation of file names printed by stats.

### --stats-log-level string ###

Log level to show `--stats` output at.  This can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`,
`NOTICE`, or `ERROR`.  The default is `INFO`.  This means at the
default level of logging which is `NOTICE` the stats won't show - if
you want them to then use `--stats-log-level NOTICE`.  See the [Logging
section](#logging) for more info on log levels.

### --stats-one-line ###

When this is specified, rclone condenses the stats into a single line
showing the most important stats only.

### --stats-one-line-date ###

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and prepends
the display with a date string. The default is `2006/01/02 15:04:05 - `

### --stats-one-line-date-format ###

When this is specified, rclone enables the single-line stats and prepends
the display with a user-supplied date string. The date string MUST be
enclosed in quotes. Follow [golang specs](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time.Format) for
date formatting syntax.

### --stats-unit=bits|bytes ###

By default, data transfer rates will be printed in bytes per second.

This option allows the data rate to be printed in bits per second.

Data transfer volume will still be reported in bytes.

The rate is reported as a binary unit, not SI unit. So 1 Mbit/s
equals 1,048,576 bit/s and not 1,000,000 bit/s.

The default is `bytes`.

### --suffix=SUFFIX ###

When using `sync`, `copy` or `move` any files which would have been
overwritten or deleted will have the suffix added to them.  If there 
is a file with the same path (after the suffix has been added), then 
it will be overwritten.

The remote in use must support server-side move or copy and you must
use the same remote as the destination of the sync.

This is for use with files to add the suffix in the current directory 
or with `--backup-dir`. See `--backup-dir` for more info.

For example

    rclone copy -i /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak

will copy `/path/to/local` to `remote:current`, but for any files
which would have been updated or deleted have .bak added.

If using `rclone sync` with `--suffix` and without `--backup-dir` then
it is recommended to put a filter rule in excluding the suffix
otherwise the `sync` will delete the backup files.

    rclone sync -i /path/to/local/file remote:current --suffix .bak --exclude "*.bak"

### --suffix-keep-extension ###

When using `--suffix`, setting this causes rclone put the SUFFIX
before the extension of the files that it backs up rather than after.

So let's say we had `--suffix -2019-01-01`, without the flag `file.txt`
would be backed up to `file.txt-2019-01-01` and with the flag it would
be backed up to `file-2019-01-01.txt`.  This can be helpful to make
sure the suffixed files can still be opened.

### --syslog ###

On capable OSes (not Windows or Plan9) send all log output to syslog.

This can be useful for running rclone in a script or `rclone mount`.

### --syslog-facility string ###

If using `--syslog` this sets the syslog facility (e.g. `KERN`, `USER`).
See `man syslog` for a list of possible facilities.  The default
facility is `DAEMON`.

### --temp-dir=DIR ###

Specify the directory rclone will use for temporary files, to override
the default. Make sure the directory exists and have accessible permissions.

By default the operating system's temp directory will be used:
- On Unix systems, `$TMPDIR` if non-empty, else `/tmp`.
- On Windows, the first non-empty value from `%TMP%`, `%TEMP%`, `%USERPROFILE%`, or the Windows directory.

When overriding the default with this option, the specified path will be
set as value of environment variable `TMPDIR` on Unix systems
and `TMP` and `TEMP` on Windows.

You can use the [config paths](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_paths/)
command to see the current value.

### --tpslimit float ###

Limit transactions per second to this number. Default is 0 which is
used to mean unlimited transactions per second.

A transaction is roughly defined as an API call; its exact meaning
will depend on the backend. For HTTP based backends it is an HTTP
PUT/GET/POST/etc and its response. For FTP/SFTP it is a round trip
transaction over TCP.

For example to limit rclone to 10 transactions per second use
`--tpslimit 10`, or to 1 transaction every 2 seconds use `--tpslimit
0.5`.

Use this when the number of transactions per second from rclone is
causing a problem with the cloud storage provider (e.g. getting you
banned or rate limited).

This can be very useful for `rclone mount` to control the behaviour of
applications using it.

This limit applies to all HTTP based backends and to the FTP and SFTP
backends. It does not apply to the local backend or the Tardigrade
backend.

See also `--tpslimit-burst`.

### --tpslimit-burst int ###

Max burst of transactions for `--tpslimit` (default `1`).

Normally `--tpslimit` will do exactly the number of transaction per
second specified.  However if you supply `--tps-burst` then rclone can
save up some transactions from when it was idle giving a burst of up
to the parameter supplied.

For example if you provide `--tpslimit-burst 10` then if rclone has
been idle for more than 10*`--tpslimit` then it can do 10 transactions
very quickly before they are limited again.

This may be used to increase performance of `--tpslimit` without
changing the long term average number of transactions per second.

### --track-renames ###

By default, rclone doesn't keep track of renamed files, so if you
rename a file locally then sync it to a remote, rclone will delete the
old file on the remote and upload a new copy.

If you use this flag, and the remote supports server-side copy or
server-side move, and the source and destination have a compatible
hash, then this will track renames during `sync`
operations and perform renaming server-side.

Files will be matched by size and hash - if both match then a rename
will be considered.

If the destination does not support server-side copy or move, rclone
will fall back to the default behaviour and log an error level message
to the console.

Encrypted destinations are not currently supported by `--track-renames`
if `--track-renames-strategy` includes `hash`.

Note that `--track-renames` is incompatible with `--no-traverse` and
that it uses extra memory to keep track of all the rename candidates.

Note also that `--track-renames` is incompatible with
`--delete-before` and will select `--delete-after` instead of
`--delete-during`.

### --track-renames-strategy (hash,modtime,leaf,size) ###

This option changes the matching criteria for `--track-renames`.

The matching is controlled by a comma separated selection of these tokens:

- `modtime` - the modification time of the file - not supported on all backends
- `hash` - the hash of the file contents - not supported on all backends
- `leaf` - the name of the file not including its directory name
- `size` - the size of the file (this is always enabled)

So using `--track-renames-strategy modtime,leaf` would match files
based on modification time, the leaf of the file name and the size
only.

Using `--track-renames-strategy modtime` or `leaf` can enable
`--track-renames` support for encrypted destinations.

If nothing is specified, the default option is matching by `hash`es.

Note that the `hash` strategy is not supported with encrypted destinations.

### --delete-(before,during,after) ###

This option allows you to specify when files on your destination are
deleted when you sync folders.

Specifying the value `--delete-before` will delete all files present
on the destination, but not on the source *before* starting the
transfer of any new or updated files. This uses two passes through the
file systems, one for the deletions and one for the copies.

Specifying `--delete-during` will delete files while checking and
uploading files. This is the fastest option and uses the least memory.

Specifying `--delete-after` (the default value) will delay deletion of
files until all new/updated files have been successfully transferred.
The files to be deleted are collected in the copy pass then deleted
after the copy pass has completed successfully.  The files to be
deleted are held in memory so this mode may use more memory.  This is
the safest mode as it will only delete files if there have been no
errors subsequent to that.  If there have been errors before the
deletions start then you will get the message `not deleting files as
there were IO errors`.

### --fast-list ###

When doing anything which involves a directory listing (e.g. `sync`,
`copy`, `ls` - in fact nearly every command), rclone normally lists a
directory and processes it before using more directory lists to
process any subdirectories.  This can be parallelised and works very
quickly using the least amount of memory.

However, some remotes have a way of listing all files beneath a
directory in one (or a small number) of transactions.  These tend to
be the bucket based remotes (e.g. S3, B2, GCS, Swift, Hubic).

If you use the `--fast-list` flag then rclone will use this method for
listing directories.  This will have the following consequences for
the listing:

  * It **will** use fewer transactions (important if you pay for them)
  * It **will** use more memory.  Rclone has to load the whole listing into memory.
  * It *may* be faster because it uses fewer transactions
  * It *may* be slower because it can't be parallelized

rclone should always give identical results with and without
`--fast-list`.

If you pay for transactions and can fit your entire sync listing into
memory then `--fast-list` is recommended.  If you have a very big sync
to do then don't use `--fast-list` otherwise you will run out of
memory.

If you use `--fast-list` on a remote which doesn't support it, then
rclone will just ignore it.

### --timeout=TIME ###

This sets the IO idle timeout.  If a transfer has started but then
becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.

The default is `5m`.  Set to `0` to disable.

### --transfers=N ###

The number of file transfers to run in parallel.  It can sometimes be
useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot
of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.

The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.

### -u, --update ###

This forces rclone to skip any files which exist on the destination
and have a modified time that is newer than the source file.

This can be useful when transferring to a remote which doesn't support
mod times directly (or when using `--use-server-modtime` to avoid extra
API calls) as it is more accurate than a `--size-only` check and faster
than using `--checksum`.

If an existing destination file has a modification time equal (within
the computed modify window precision) to the source file's, it will be
updated if the sizes are different.  If `--checksum` is set then
rclone will update the destination if the checksums differ too.

If an existing destination file is older than the source file then
it will be updated if the size or checksum differs from the source file.

On remotes which don't support mod time directly (or when using
`--use-server-modtime`) the time checked will be the uploaded time.
This means that if uploading to one of these remotes, rclone will skip
any files which exist on the destination and have an uploaded time that
is newer than the modification time of the source file.

### --use-mmap ###

If this flag is set then rclone will use anonymous memory allocated by
mmap on Unix based platforms and VirtualAlloc on Windows for its
transfer buffers (size controlled by `--buffer-size`).  Memory
allocated like this does not go on the Go heap and can be returned to
the OS immediately when it is finished with.

If this flag is not set then rclone will allocate and free the buffers
using the Go memory allocator which may use more memory as memory
pages are returned less aggressively to the OS.

It is possible this does not work well on all platforms so it is
disabled by default; in the future it may be enabled by default.

### --use-server-modtime ###

Some object-store backends (e.g, Swift, S3) do not preserve file modification
times (modtime). On these backends, rclone stores the original modtime as
additional metadata on the object. By default it will make an API call to
retrieve the metadata when the modtime is needed by an operation.

Use this flag to disable the extra API call and rely instead on the server's
modified time. In cases such as a local to remote sync using `--update`,
knowing the local file is newer than the time it was last uploaded to the
remote is sufficient. In those cases, this flag can speed up the process and
reduce the number of API calls necessary.

Using this flag on a sync operation without also using `--update` would cause
all files modified at any time other than the last upload time to be uploaded
again, which is probably not what you want.

### -v, -vv, --verbose ###

With `-v` rclone will tell you about each file that is transferred and
a small number of significant events.

With `-vv` rclone will become very verbose telling you about every
file it considers and transfers.  Please send bug reports with a log
with this setting.

### -V, --version ###

Prints the version number

SSL/TLS options
---------------

The outgoing SSL/TLS connections rclone makes can be controlled with
these options.  For example this can be very useful with the HTTP or
WebDAV backends. Rclone HTTP servers have their own set of
configuration for SSL/TLS which you can find in their documentation.

### --ca-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded certificate authority certificate and uses
it to verify the certificates of the servers rclone connects to.

If you have generated certificates signed with a local CA then you
will need this flag to connect to servers using those certificates.

### --client-cert string

This loads the PEM encoded client side certificate.

This is used for [mutual TLS authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_authentication).

The `--client-key` flag is required too when using this.

### --client-key string

This loads the PEM encoded client side private key used for mutual TLS
authentication.  Used in conjunction with `--client-cert`.

### --no-check-certificate=true/false ###

`--no-check-certificate` controls whether a client verifies the
server's certificate chain and host name.
If `--no-check-certificate` is true, TLS accepts any certificate
presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

This option defaults to `false`.

**This should be used only for testing.**

Configuration Encryption
------------------------
Your configuration file contains information for logging in to 
your cloud services. This means that you should keep your 
`rclone.conf` file in a secure location.

If you are in an environment where that isn't possible, you can
add a password to your configuration. This means that you will
have to supply the password every time you start rclone.

To add a password to your rclone configuration, execute `rclone config`.

```
>rclone config
Current remotes:

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/s/q>
```

Go into `s`, Set configuration password:
```
e/n/d/s/q> s
Your configuration is not encrypted.
If you add a password, you will protect your login information to cloud services.
a) Add Password
q) Quit to main menu
a/q> a
Enter NEW configuration password:
password:
Confirm NEW password:
password:
Password set
Your configuration is encrypted.
c) Change Password
u) Unencrypt configuration
q) Quit to main menu
c/u/q>
```

Your configuration is now encrypted, and every time you start rclone
you will have to supply the password. See below for details.
In the same menu, you can change the password or completely remove
encryption from your configuration.

There is no way to recover the configuration if you lose your password.

rclone uses [nacl secretbox](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) 
which in turn uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and authenticate 
your configuration with secret-key cryptography.
The password is SHA-256 hashed, which produces the key for secretbox.
The hashed password is not stored.

While this provides very good security, we do not recommend storing
your encrypted rclone configuration in public if it contains sensitive
information, maybe except if you use a very strong password.

If it is safe in your environment, you can set the `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS`
environment variable to contain your password, in which case it will be
used for decrypting the configuration.

You can set this for a session from a script.  For unix like systems
save this to a file called `set-rclone-password`:

```
#!/bin/echo Source this file don't run it

read -s RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
export RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS
```

Then source the file when you want to use it.  From the shell you
would do `source set-rclone-password`.  It will then ask you for the
password and set it in the environment variable.

An alternate means of supplying the password is to provide a script
which will retrieve the password and print on standard output.  This
script should have a fully specified path name and not rely on any
environment variables.  The script is supplied either via
`--password-command="..."` command line argument or via the
`RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND` environment variable.

One useful example of this is using the `passwordstore` application
to retrieve the password:

```
export RCLONE_PASSWORD_COMMAND="pass rclone/config"
```

If the `passwordstore` password manager holds the password for the
rclone configuration, using the script method means the password
is primarily protected by the `passwordstore` system, and is never
embedded in the clear in scripts, nor available for examination
using the standard commands available.  It is quite possible with
long running rclone sessions for copies of passwords to be innocently
captured in log files or terminal scroll buffers, etc.  Using the
script method of supplying the password enhances the security of
the config password considerably.

If you are running rclone inside a script, unless you are using the
`--password-command` method, you might want to disable 
password prompts. To do that, pass the parameter 
`--ask-password=false` to rclone. This will make rclone fail instead
of asking for a password if `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` doesn't contain
a valid password, and `--password-command` has not been supplied.

Whenever running commands that may be affected by options in a
configuration file, rclone will look for an existing file according
to the rules described [above](#config-config-file), and load any it
finds. If an encrypted file is found, this includes decrypting it,
with the possible consequence of a password prompt. When executing
a command line that you know are not actually using anything from such
a configuration file, you can avoid it being loaded by overriding the
location, e.g. with one of the documented special values for
memory-only configuration. Since only backend options can be stored
in configuration files, this is normally unnecessary for commands
that do not operate on backends, e.g. `genautocomplete`. However,
it will be relevant for commands that do operate on backends in
general, but are used without referencing a stored remote, e.g.
listing local filesystem paths, or
[connection strings](#connection-strings): `rclone --config="" ls .`

Developer options
-----------------

These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.  There
are also some more remote specific options which aren't documented
here which are used for testing.  These start with remote name e.g.
`--drive-test-option` - see the docs for the remote in question.

### --cpuprofile=FILE ###

Write CPU profile to file.  This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

#### --dump flag,flag,flag ####

The `--dump` flag takes a comma separated list of flags to dump info
about.

Note that some headers including `Accept-Encoding` as shown may not 
be correct in the request and the response may not show `Content-Encoding`
if the go standard libraries auto gzip encoding was in effect. In this case 
the body of the request will be gunzipped before showing it.

The available flags are:

#### --dump headers ####

Dump HTTP headers with `Authorization:` lines removed. May still
contain sensitive info.  Can be very verbose.  Useful for debugging
only.

Use `--dump auth` if you do want the `Authorization:` headers.

#### --dump bodies ####

Dump HTTP headers and bodies - may contain sensitive info.  Can be
very verbose.  Useful for debugging only.

Note that the bodies are buffered in memory so don't use this for
enormous files.

#### --dump requests ####

Like `--dump bodies` but dumps the request bodies and the response
headers.  Useful for debugging download problems.

#### --dump responses ####

Like `--dump bodies` but dumps the response bodies and the request
headers. Useful for debugging upload problems.

#### --dump auth ####

Dump HTTP headers - will contain sensitive info such as
`Authorization:` headers - use `--dump headers` to dump without
`Authorization:` headers.  Can be very verbose.  Useful for debugging
only.

#### --dump filters ####

Dump the filters to the output.  Useful to see exactly what include
and exclude options are filtering on.

#### --dump goroutines ####

This dumps a list of the running go-routines at the end of the command
to standard output.

#### --dump openfiles ####

This dumps a list of the open files at the end of the command.  It
uses the `lsof` command to do that so you'll need that installed to
use it.

### --memprofile=FILE ###

Write memory profile to file. This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

Filtering
---------

For the filtering options

  * `--delete-excluded`
  * `--filter`
  * `--filter-from`
  * `--exclude`
  * `--exclude-from`
  * `--include`
  * `--include-from`
  * `--files-from`

  * `--max-size`
  * `--min-age`
  * `--max-age`
  * `--dump filters`

See the [filtering section](https://rclone.org/filtering/).

Remote control
--------------

For the remote control options and for instructions on how to remote control rclone

  * `--rc`
  * and anything starting with `--rc-`

See [the remote control section](https://rclone.org/rc/).

Logging
-------

rclone has 4 levels of logging, `ERROR`, `NOTICE`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`.

By default, rclone logs to standard error.  This means you can redirect
standard error and still see the normal output of rclone commands (e.g.
`rclone ls`).

By default, rclone will produce `Error` and `Notice` level messages.

If you use the `-q` flag, rclone will only produce `Error` messages.

If you use the `-v` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Notice` and
`Info` messages.

If you use the `-vv` flag, rclone will produce `Error`, `Notice`,
`Info` and `Debug` messages.

You can also control the log levels with the `--log-level` flag.

If you use the `--log-file=FILE` option, rclone will redirect `Error`,
`Info` and `Debug` messages along with standard error to FILE.

If you use the `--syslog` flag then rclone will log to syslog and the
`--syslog-facility` control which facility it uses.

Rclone prefixes all log messages with their level in capitals, e.g. INFO
which makes it easy to grep the log file for different kinds of
information.

Exit Code
---------

If any errors occur during the command execution, rclone will exit with a
non-zero exit code.  This allows scripts to detect when rclone
operations have failed.

During the startup phase, rclone will exit immediately if an error is
detected in the configuration.  There will always be a log message
immediately before exiting.

When rclone is running it will accumulate errors as it goes along, and
only exit with a non-zero exit code if (after retries) there were
still failed transfers.  For every error counted there will be a high
priority log message (visible with `-q`) showing the message and
which file caused the problem. A high priority message is also shown
when starting a retry so the user can see that any previous error
messages may not be valid after the retry. If rclone has done a retry
it will log a high priority message if the retry was successful.

### List of exit codes ###
  * `0` - success
  * `1` - Syntax or usage error
  * `2` - Error not otherwise categorised
  * `3` - Directory not found
  * `4` - File not found
  * `5` - Temporary error (one that more retries might fix) (Retry errors)
  * `6` - Less serious errors (like 461 errors from dropbox) (NoRetry errors)
  * `7` - Fatal error (one that more retries won't fix, like account suspended) (Fatal errors)
  * `8` - Transfer exceeded - limit set by --max-transfer reached
  * `9` - Operation successful, but no files transferred

Environment Variables
---------------------

Rclone can be configured entirely using environment variables.  These
can be used to set defaults for options or config file entries.

### Options ###

Every option in rclone can have its default set by environment
variable.

To find the name of the environment variable, first, take the long
option name, strip the leading `--`, change `-` to `_`, make
upper case and prepend `RCLONE_`.

For example, to always set `--stats 5s`, set the environment variable
`RCLONE_STATS=5s`.  If you set stats on the command line this will
override the environment variable setting.

Or to always use the trash in drive `--drive-use-trash`, set
`RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_TRASH=true`.

The same parser is used for the options and the environment variables
so they take exactly the same form.

The options set by environment variables can be seen with the `-vv` flag, e.g. `rclone version -vv`.

### Config file ###

You can set defaults for values in the config file on an individual
remote basis. The names of the config items are documented in the page
for each backend.

To find the name of the environment variable, you need to set, take
`RCLONE_CONFIG_` + name of remote + `_` + name of config file option
and make it all uppercase.

For example, to configure an S3 remote named `mys3:` without a config
file (using unix ways of setting environment variables):

```
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_TYPE=s3
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
$ export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone listremotes | grep mys3
mys3:
```

Note that if you want to create a remote using environment variables
you must create the `..._TYPE` variable as above.

Note that the name of a remote created using environment variable is
case insensitive, in contrast to regular remotes stored in config
file as documented [above](#valid-remote-names).
You must write the name in uppercase in the environment variable, but
as seen from example above it will be listed and can be accessed in
lowercase, while you can also refer to the same remote in uppercase:
```
$ rclone lsd mys3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
$ rclone lsd MYS3:
          -1 2016-09-21 12:54:21        -1 my-bucket
```


Note that you can only set the options of the immediate backend, 
so RCLONE_CONFIG_MYS3CRYPT_ACCESS_KEY_ID has no effect, if myS3Crypt is 
a crypt remote based on an S3 remote. However RCLONE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID will 
set the access key of all remotes using S3, including myS3Crypt.

Note also that now rclone has [connection strings](#connection-strings),
it is probably easier to use those instead which makes the above example

    rclone lsd :s3,access_key_id=XXX,secret_access_key=XXX:

### Precedence

The various different methods of backend configuration are read in
this order and the first one with a value is used.

- Parameters in connection strings, e.g. `myRemote,skip_links:`
- Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. `--skip-links`
- Remote specific environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_SKIP_LINKS` (see above).
- Backend specific environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS`.
- Backend generic environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_SKIP_LINKS`.
- Config file, e.g. `skip_links = true`.
- Default values, e.g. `false` - these can't be changed.

So if both `--skip-links` is supplied on the command line and an
environment variable `RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS` is set, the command line
flag will take preference.

The backend configurations set by environment variables can be seen with the `-vv` flag, e.g. `rclone about myRemote: -vv`.

For non backend configuration the order is as follows:

- Flag values as supplied on the command line, e.g. `--stats 5s`.
- Environment vars, e.g. `RCLONE_STATS=5s`.
- Default values, e.g. `1m` - these can't be changed.

### Other environment variables ###

- `RCLONE_CONFIG_PASS` set to contain your config file password (see [Configuration Encryption](#configuration-encryption) section)
- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` (or the lowercase versions thereof).
    - `HTTPS_PROXY` takes precedence over `HTTP_PROXY` for https requests.
    - The environment values may be either a complete URL or a "host[:port]" for, in which case the "http" scheme is assumed.
- `USER` and `LOGNAME` values are used as fallbacks for current username. The primary method for looking up username is OS-specific: Windows API on Windows, real user ID in /etc/passwd on Unix systems. In the documentation the current username is simply referred to as `$USER`.
- `RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR` - rclone **sets** this variable for use in config files and sub processes to point to the directory holding the config file.

The options set by environment variables can be seen with the `-vv` and `--log-level=DEBUG` flags, e.g. `rclone version -vv`.

# Configuring rclone on a remote / headless machine #

Some of the configurations (those involving oauth2) require an
Internet connected web browser.

If you are trying to set rclone up on a remote or headless box with no
browser available on it (e.g. a NAS or a server in a datacenter) then
you will need to use an alternative means of configuration.  There are
two ways of doing it, described below.

## Configuring using rclone authorize ##

On the headless box run `rclone` config but answer `N` to the `Use
auto config?` question.

```
...
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes (default)
n) No
y/n> n
For this to work, you will need rclone available on a machine that has
a web browser available.

For more help and alternate methods see: https://rclone.org/remote_setup/

Execute the following on the machine with the web browser (same rclone
version recommended):

	rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"

Then paste the result below:
result>
```

Then on your main desktop machine

```
rclone authorize "amazon cloud drive"
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
Paste the following into your remote machine --->
SECRET_TOKEN
<---End paste
```

Then back to the headless box, paste in the code

```
result> SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
[acd12]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = SECRET_TOKEN
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d>
```

## Configuring by copying the config file ##

Rclone stores all of its config in a single configuration file.  This
can easily be copied to configure a remote rclone.

So first configure rclone on your desktop machine with

    rclone config

to set up the config file.

Find the config file by running `rclone config file`, for example

```
$ rclone config file
Configuration file is stored at:
/home/user/.rclone.conf
```

Now transfer it to the remote box (scp, cut paste, ftp, sftp, etc.) and
place it in the correct place (use `rclone config file` on the remote
box to find out where).

# Filtering, includes and excludes

Filter flags determine which files rclone `sync`, `move`, `ls`, `lsl`,
`md5sum`, `sha1sum`, `size`, `delete`, `check` and similar commands
apply to.

They are specified in terms of path/file name patterns; path/file
lists; file age and size, or presence of a file in a directory. Bucket
based remotes without the concept of directory apply filters to object
key, age and size in an analogous way.

Rclone `purge` does not obey filters.

To test filters without risk of damage to data, apply them to `rclone
ls`, or with the `--dry-run` and `-vv` flags.

Rclone filter patterns can only be used in filter command line options, not
in the specification of a remote.

E.g. `rclone copy "remote:dir*.jpg" /path/to/dir` does not have a filter effect.
`rclone copy remote:dir /path/to/dir --include "*.jpg"` does.

**Important** Avoid mixing any two of `--include...`, `--exclude...` or
`--filter...` flags in an rclone command. The results may not be what
you expect. Instead use a `--filter...` flag.

## Patterns for matching path/file names

### Pattern syntax

Rclone matching rules follow a glob style:

    *         matches any sequence of non-separator (/) characters
    **        matches any sequence of characters including / separators
    ?         matches any single non-separator (/) character
    [ [ ! ] { character-range } ]
              character class (must be non-empty)
    { pattern-list }
              pattern alternatives
    c         matches character c (c != *, **, ?, \, [, {, })
    \c        matches reserved character c (c = *, **, ?, \, [, {, })

character-range:

    c         matches character c (c != \, -, ])
    \c        matches reserved character c (c = \, -, ])
    lo - hi   matches character c for lo <= c <= hi

pattern-list:

    pattern { , pattern }
              comma-separated (without spaces) patterns

character classes (see [Go regular expression reference](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)) include:

    Named character classes (e.g. [\d], [^\d], [\D], [^\D])
    Perl character classes (e.g. \s, \S, \w, \W)
    ASCII character classes (e.g. [[:alnum:]], [[:alpha:]], [[:punct:]], [[:xdigit:]])

If the filter pattern starts with a `/` then it only matches
at the top level of the directory tree,
**relative to the root of the remote** (not necessarily the root
of the drive). If it does not start with `/` then it is matched
starting at the **end of the path/file name** but it only matches
a complete path element - it must match from a `/`
separator or the beginning of the path/file.

    file.jpg   - matches "file.jpg"
               - matches "directory/file.jpg"
               - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
               - doesn't match "directory/afile.jpg"
    /file.jpg  - matches "file.jpg" in the root directory of the remote
               - doesn't match "afile.jpg"
               - doesn't match "directory/file.jpg"

The top level of the remote may not be the top level of the drive.

E.g. for a Microsoft Windows local directory structure

    F:
    ├── bkp
    ├── data
    │   ├── excl
    │   │   ├── 123.jpg
    │   │   └── 456.jpg
    │   ├── incl
    │   │   └── document.pdf

To copy the contents of folder `data` into folder `bkp` excluding the contents of subfolder
`excl`the following command treats `F:\data` and `F:\bkp` as top level for filtering.

`rclone copy F:\data\ F:\bkp\ --exclude=/excl/**`

**Important** Use `/` in path/file name patterns and not `\` even if
running on Microsoft Windows.

Simple patterns are case sensitive unless the `--ignore-case` flag is used.

Without `--ignore-case` (default)

    potato - matches "potato"
           - doesn't match "POTATO"

With `--ignore-case`

    potato - matches "potato"
           - matches "POTATO"

## How filter rules are applied to files

Rclone path/file name filters are made up of one or more of the following flags:

  * `--include`
  * `--include-from`
  * `--exclude`
  * `--exclude-from`
  * `--filter`
  * `--filter-from`

There can be more than one instance of individual flags.

Rclone internally uses a combined list of all the include and exclude
rules. The order in which rules are processed can influence the result
of the filter.

All flags of the same type are processed together in the order
above, regardless of what order the different types of flags are
included on the command line.

Multiple instances of the same flag are processed from left
to right according to their position in the command line.

To mix up the order of processing includes and excludes use `--filter...`
flags.

Within `--include-from`, `--exclude-from` and `--filter-from` flags
rules are processed from top to bottom of the referenced file.

If there is an `--include` or `--include-from` flag specified, rclone
implies a `- **` rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule
list. Specifying a `+` rule with a `--filter...` flag does not imply
that rule.

Each path/file name passed through rclone is matched against the
combined filter list. At first match to a rule the path/file name
is included or excluded and no further filter rules are processed for
that path/file.

If rclone does not find a match, after testing against all rules
(including the implied rule if appropriate), the path/file name
is included.

Any path/file included at that stage is processed by the rclone
command.

`--files-from` and `--files-from-raw` flags over-ride and cannot be
combined with other filter options.

To see the internal combined rule list, in regular expression form,
for a command add the `--dump filters` flag. Running an rclone command
with `--dump filters` and `-vv` flags lists the internal filter elements
and shows how they are applied to each source path/file. There is not
currently a means provided to pass regular expression filter options into
rclone directly though character class filter rules contain character
classes. [Go regular expression reference](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/)

### How filter rules are applied to directories

Rclone commands are applied to path/file names not
directories. The entire contents of a directory can be matched
to a filter by the pattern `directory/*` or recursively by
`directory/**`.

Directory filter rules are defined with a closing `/` separator.

E.g. `/directory/subdirectory/` is an rclone directory filter rule.

Rclone commands can use directory filter rules to determine whether they
recurse into subdirectories. This potentially optimises access to a remote
by avoiding listing unnecessary directories. Whether optimisation is
desirable depends on the specific filter rules and source remote content.

Directory recursion optimisation occurs if either:

* A source remote does not support the rclone `ListR` primitive. local,
sftp, Microsoft OneDrive and WebDav do not support `ListR`. Google
Drive and most bucket type storage do. [Full list](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)

* On other remotes (those that support `ListR`), if the rclone command is not naturally recursive, and
provided it is not run with the `--fast-list` flag. `ls`, `lsf -R` and
`size` are naturally recursive but `sync`, `copy` and `move` are not.

* Whenever the `--disable ListR` flag is applied to an rclone command.

Rclone commands imply directory filter rules from path/file filter
rules. To view the directory filter rules rclone has implied for a
command specify the `--dump filters` flag.

E.g. for an include rule

    /a/*.jpg

Rclone implies the directory include rule

    /a/

Directory filter rules specified in an rclone command can limit
the scope of an rclone command but path/file filters still have
to be specified.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --include /directory/` will not match any
files. Because it is an `--include` option the `--exclude **` rule
is implied, and the `/directory/` pattern serves only to optimise
access to the remote by ignoring everything outside of that directory.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-list.txt` with a file
`filter-list.txt`:

    - /dir1/
    - /dir2/
    + *.pdf
    - **

All files in directories `dir1` or `dir2` or their subdirectories
are completely excluded from the listing. Only files of suffix
`pdf` in the root of `remote:` or its subdirectories are listed.
The `- **` rule prevents listing of any path/files not previously
matched by the rules above.

Option `exclude-if-present` creates a directory exclude rule based
on the presence of a file in a directory and takes precedence over
other rclone directory filter rules.

When using pattern list syntax, if a pattern item contains either
`/` or `**`, then rclone will not able to imply a directory filter rule
from this pattern list.

E.g. for an include rule

    {dir1/**,dir2/**}

Rclone will match files below directories `dir1` or `dir2` only,
but will not be able to use this filter to exclude a directory `dir3`
from being traversed.

Directory recursion optimisation may affect performance, but normally
not the result. One exception to this is sync operations with option
`--create-empty-src-dirs`, where any traversed empty directories will
be created. With the pattern list example `{dir1/**,dir2/**}` above,
this would create an empty directory `dir3` on destination (when it exists
on source). Changing the filter to `{dir1,dir2}/**`, or splitting it into
two include rules `--include dir1/** --include dir2/**`, will match the
same files while also filtering directories, with the result that an empty
directory `dir3` will no longer be created.

### `--exclude` - Exclude files matching pattern

Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on a single exclude
rule.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

`--exclude` should not be used with `--include`, `--include-from`,
`--filter` or `--filter-from` flags.

`--exclude` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --exclude *.bak` excludes all .bak files
from listing.

E.g. `rclone size remote: "--exclude /dir/**"` returns the total size of
all files on `remote:` excluding those in root directory `dir` and sub
directories.

E.g. on Microsoft Windows `rclone ls remote: --exclude "*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*"`
lists the files in `remote:` with `[JP]` or `[KR]` or `[HK]` in
their name. Quotes prevent the shell from interpreting the `\`
characters.`\` characters escape the `[` and `]` so an rclone filter
treats them literally rather than as a character-range. The `{` and `}`
define an rclone pattern list. For other operating systems single quotes are
required ie `rclone ls remote: --exclude '*\[{JP,KR,HK}\]*'`

### `--exclude-from` - Read exclude patterns from file

Excludes path/file names from an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.

For an example `exclude-file.txt`:

    # a sample exclude rule file
    *.bak
    file2.jpg

`rclone ls remote: --exclude-from exclude-file.txt` lists the files on
`remote:` except those named `file2.jpg` or with a suffix `.bak`. That is
equivalent to `rclone ls remote: --exclude file2.jpg --exclude "*.bak"`.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

The `--exclude-from` flag is useful where multiple exclude filter rules
are applied to an rclone command.

`--exclude-from` should not be used with `--include`, `--include-from`,
`--filter` or `--filter-from` flags.

`--exclude-from` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--exclude-from` followed by `-` reads filter rules from standard input.

### `--include` - Include files matching pattern

Adds a single include rule based on path/file names to an rclone
command.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

`--include` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--include` implies `--exclude **` at the end of an rclone internal
filter list. Therefore if you mix `--include` and `--include-from`
flags with `--exclude`, `--exclude-from`, `--filter` or `--filter-from`,
you must use include rules for all the files you want in the include
statement. For more flexibility use the `--filter-from` flag.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --include "*.{png,jpg}"` lists the files on
`remote:` with suffix `.png` and `.jpg`. All other files are excluded.

E.g. multiple rclone copy commands can be combined with `--include` and a
pattern-list.

    rclone copy /vol1/A remote:A
    rclone copy /vol1/B remote:B

is equivalent to:

    rclone copy /vol1 remote: --include "{A,B}/**"

E.g. `rclone ls remote:/wheat --include "??[^[:punct:]]*"` lists the
files `remote:` directory `wheat` (and subdirectories) whose third
character is not punctuation. This example uses
an [ASCII character class](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).

### `--include-from` - Read include patterns from file

Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules.

For an example `include-file.txt`:

    # a sample include rule file
    *.jpg
    file2.avi

`rclone ls remote: --include-from include-file.txt` lists the files on
`remote:` with name `file2.avi` or suffix `.jpg`. That is equivalent to
`rclone ls remote: --include file2.avi --include "*.jpg"`.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

The `--include-from` flag is useful where multiple include filter rules
are applied to an rclone command.

`--include-from` implies `--exclude **` at the end of an rclone internal
filter list. Therefore if you mix `--include` and `--include-from`
flags with `--exclude`, `--exclude-from`, `--filter` or `--filter-from`,
you must use include rules for all the files you want in the include
statement. For more flexibility use the `--filter-from` flag.

`--exclude-from` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--exclude-from` followed by `-` reads filter rules from standard input.

### `--filter` - Add a file-filtering rule

Specifies path/file names to an rclone command, based on a single
include or exclude rule, in `+` or `-` format. 

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

`--filter +` differs from `--include`. In the case of `--include` rclone
implies an `--exclude *` rule which it adds to the bottom of the internal rule
list. `--filter...+` does not imply
that rule.

`--filter` has no effect when combined with `--files-from` or
`--files-from-raw` flags.

`--filter` should not be used with `--include`, `--include-from`,
`--exclude` or `--exclude-from` flags.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --filter "- *.bak"` excludes all `.bak` files
from a list of `remote:`.

### `--filter-from` - Read filtering patterns from a file

Adds path/file names to an rclone command based on rules in a
named file. The file contains a list of remarks and pattern rules. Include
rules start with `+ ` and exclude rules with `- `. `!` clears existing
rules. Rules are processed in the order they are defined.

This flag can be repeated. See above for the order filter flags are
processed in.

Arrange the order of filter rules with the most restrictive first and
work down.

E.g. for `filter-file.txt`:

    # a sample filter rule file
    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - /dir/Trash/**
    + /dir/**
    # exclude everything else
    - *

`rclone ls remote: --filter-from filter-file.txt` lists the path/files on
`remote:` including all `jpg` and `png` files, excluding any
matching `secret*.jpg` and including `file2.avi`.  It also includes
everything in the directory `dir` at the root of `remote`, except
`remote:dir/Trash` which it excludes.  Everything else is excluded.


E.g. for an alternative `filter-file.txt`:

    - secret*.jpg
    + *.jpg
    + *.png
    + file2.avi
    - *

Files `file1.jpg`, `file3.png` and `file2.avi` are listed whilst
`secret17.jpg` and files without the suffix .jpg` or `.png` are excluded.

E.g. for an alternative `filter-file.txt`:

    + *.jpg
    + *.gif
    !
    + 42.doc
    - *

Only file 42.doc is listed. Prior rules are cleared by the `!`.

### `--files-from` - Read list of source-file names

Adds path/files to an rclone command from a list in a named file.
Rclone processes the path/file names in the order of the list, and
no others.

Other filter flags (`--include`, `--include-from`, `--exclude`,
`--exclude-from`, `--filter` and `--filter-from`) are ignored when
`--files-from` is used.

`--files-from` expects a list of files as its input. Leading or
trailing whitespace is stripped from the input lines. Lines starting
with `#` or `;` are ignored.

Rclone commands with a `--files-from` flag traverse the remote,
treating the names in `--files-from` as a set of filters.

If the `--no-traverse` and `--files-from` flags are used together
an rclone command does not traverse the remote. Instead it addresses
each path/file named in the file individually. For each path/file name, that
requires typically 1 API call. This can be efficient for a short `--files-from`
list and a remote containing many files.

Rclone commands do not error if any names in the `--files-from` file are
missing from the source remote.

The `--files-from` flag can be repeated in a single rclone command to
read path/file names from more than one file. The files are read from left
to right along the command line.

Paths within the `--files-from` file are interpreted as starting
with the root specified in the rclone command.  Leading `/` separators are
ignored. See [--files-from-raw](#files-from-raw-read-list-of-source-file-names-without-any-processing) if
you need the input to be processed in a raw manner.

E.g. for a file `files-from.txt`:

    # comment
    file1.jpg
    subdir/file2.jpg

`rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home/me/pics remote:pics`
copies the following, if they exist, and only those files.

    /home/me/pics/file1.jpg        → remote:pics/file1.jpg
    /home/me/pics/subdir/file2.jpg → remote:pics/subdir/file2.jpg

E.g. to copy the following files referenced by their absolute paths:

    /home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect

First find a common subdirectory - in this case `/home`
and put the remaining files in `files-from.txt` with or without
leading `/`, e.g.

    user1/42
    user1/dir/ford
    user2/prefect

Then copy these to a remote:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt /home remote:backup

The three files are transferred as follows:

    /home/user1/42       → remote:backup/user1/important
    /home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/user1/dir/file
    /home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/user2/stuff

Alternatively if `/` is chosen as root `files-from.txt` will be:

    /home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect

The copy command will be:

    rclone copy --files-from files-from.txt / remote:backup

Then there will be an extra `home` directory on the remote:

    /home/user1/42       → remote:backup/home/user1/42
    /home/user1/dir/ford → remote:backup/home/user1/dir/ford
    /home/user2/prefect  → remote:backup/home/user2/prefect

### `--files-from-raw` - Read list of source-file names without any processing

This flag is the same as `--files-from` except that input is read in a
raw manner. Lines with leading / trailing whitespace, and lines starting
with `;` or `#` are read without any processing. [rclone lsf](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_lsf/) has
a compatible format that can be used to export file lists from remotes for
input to `--files-from-raw`.

### `--ignore-case` - make searches case insensitive

By default rclone filter patterns are case sensitive. The `--ignore-case`
flag makes all of the filters patterns on the command line case
insensitive.

E.g. `--include "zaphod.txt"` does not match a file `Zaphod.txt`. With
`--ignore-case` a match is made.

## Quoting shell metacharacters

Rclone commands with filter patterns containing shell metacharacters may
not as work as expected in your shell and may require quoting.

E.g. linux, OSX (`*` metacharacter)

  * `--include \*.jpg`
  * `--include '*.jpg'`
  * `--include='*.jpg'`

Microsoft Windows expansion is done by the command, not shell, so
`--include *.jpg` does not require quoting.

If the rclone error
`Command .... needs .... arguments maximum: you provided .... non flag arguments:`
is encountered, the cause is commonly spaces within the name of a
remote or flag value. The fix then is to quote values containing spaces.

## Other filters

### `--min-size` - Don't transfer any file smaller than this

Controls the minimum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are `KiB` but abbreviations `K`, `M`, `G`, `T` or `P` are valid.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --min-size 50k` lists files on `remote:` of 50 KiB
size or larger.

### `--max-size` - Don't transfer any file larger than this

Controls the maximum size file within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are `KiB` but abbreviations `K`, `M`, `G`, `T` or `P` are valid.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --max-size 1G` lists files on `remote:` of 1 GiB
size or smaller.

### `--max-age` - Don't transfer any file older than this

Controls the maximum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
Default units are seconds or the following abbreviations are valid:

  * `ms` - Milliseconds
  * `s`  - Seconds
  * `m`  - Minutes
  * `h`  - Hours
  * `d`  - Days
  * `w`  - Weeks
  * `M`  - Months
  * `y`  - Years

`--max-age` can also be specified as an absolute time in the following
formats:

- RFC3339 - e.g. `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z` or `2006-01-02T15:04:05+07:00`
- ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - `2006-01-02T15:04:05`
- ISO8601 Date and time, local timezone - `2006-01-02 15:04:05`
- ISO8601 Date - `2006-01-02` (YYYY-MM-DD)

`--max-age` applies only to files and not to directories.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --max-age 2d` lists files on `remote:` of 2 days
old or less.

### `--min-age` - Don't transfer any file younger than this

Controls the minimum age of files within the scope of an rclone command.
(see `--max-age` for valid formats)

`--min-age` applies only to files and not to directories.

E.g. `rclone ls remote: --min-age 2d` lists files on `remote:` of 2 days
old or more.

## Other flags

### `--delete-excluded` - Delete files on dest excluded from sync

**Important** this flag is dangerous to your data - use with `--dry-run`
and `-v` first.

In conjunction with `rclone sync`, `--delete-excluded` deletes any files
on the destination which are excluded from the command.

E.g. the scope of `rclone sync -i A: B:` can be restricted:

    rclone --min-size 50k --delete-excluded sync A: B:

All files on `B:` which are less than 50 KiB are deleted
because they are excluded from the rclone sync command.

### `--dump filters` - dump the filters to the output

Dumps the defined filters to standard output in regular expression
format.

Useful for debugging.

## Exclude directory based on a file

The `--exclude-if-present` flag controls whether a directory is
within the scope of an rclone command based on the presence of a
named file within it.

This flag has a priority over other filter flags.

E.g. for the following directory structure:

    dir1/file1
    dir1/dir2/file2
    dir1/dir2/dir3/file3
    dir1/dir2/dir3/.ignore

The command `rclone ls --exclude-if-present .ignore dir1` does
not list `dir3`, `file3` or `.ignore`.

`--exclude-if-present` can only be used once in an rclone command.

## Common pitfalls

The most frequent filter support issues on
the [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/) are:

* Not using paths relative to the root of the remote
* Not using `/` to match from the root of a remote
* Not using `**` to match the contents of a directory

# GUI (Experimental)

Rclone can serve a web based GUI (graphical user interface).  This is
somewhat experimental at the moment so things may be subject to
change.

Run this command in a terminal and rclone will download and then
display the GUI in a web browser.

```
rclone rcd --rc-web-gui
```

This will produce logs like this and rclone needs to continue to run to serve the GUI:
    
```
2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: A new release for gui is present at https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/download/v0.0.6/currentbuild.zip
2019/08/25 11:40:14 NOTICE: Downloading webgui binary. Please wait. [Size: 3813937, Path :  /home/USER/.cache/rclone/webgui/v0.0.6.zip]
2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Unzipping
2019/08/25 11:40:16 NOTICE: Serving remote control on http://127.0.0.1:5572/
```

This assumes you are running rclone locally on your machine.  It is
possible to separate the rclone and the GUI - see below for details.

If you wish to check for updates then you can add `--rc-web-gui-update` 
to the command line.

If you find your GUI broken, you may force it to update by add `--rc-web-gui-force-update`.

By default, rclone will open your browser. Add `--rc-web-gui-no-open-browser` 
to disable this feature.

## Using the GUI

Once the GUI opens, you will be looking at the dashboard which has an overall overview.

On the left hand side you will see a series of view buttons you can click on:

- Dashboard - main overview
- Configs - examine and create new configurations
- Explorer - view, download and upload files to the cloud storage systems
- Backend - view or alter the backend config
- Log out

(More docs and walkthrough video to come!)

## How it works

When you run the `rclone rcd --rc-web-gui` this is what happens

- Rclone starts but only runs the remote control API ("rc").
- The API is bound to localhost with an auto generated username and password.
- If the API bundle is missing then rclone will download it.
- rclone will start serving the files from the API bundle over the same port as the API
- rclone will open the browser with a `login_token` so it can log straight in.

## Advanced use

The `rclone rcd` may use any of the [flags documented on the rc page](https://rclone.org/rc/#supported-parameters).

The flag `--rc-web-gui` is shorthand for

- Download the web GUI if necessary
- Check we are using some authentication
- `--rc-user gui`
- `--rc-pass <random password>`
- `--rc-serve`

These flags can be overridden as desired.

See also the [rclone rcd documentation](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).

### Example: Running a public GUI

For example the GUI could be served on a public port over SSL using an htpasswd file using the following flags:

- `--rc-web-gui`
- `--rc-addr :443`
- `--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd`
- `--rc-cert /path/to/ssl.crt`
- `--rc-key /path/to/ssl.key`

### Example: Running a GUI behind a proxy

If you want to run the GUI behind a proxy at `/rclone` you could use these flags:

- `--rc-web-gui`
- `--rc-baseurl rclone`
- `--rc-htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd`

Or instead of htpasswd if you just want a single user and password:

- `--rc-user me`
- `--rc-pass mypassword`

## Project

The GUI is being developed in the: [rclone/rclone-webui-react repository](https://github.com/rclone/rclone-webui-react).

Bug reports and contributions are very welcome :-)

If you have questions then please ask them on the [rclone forum](https://forum.rclone.org/).

# Remote controlling rclone with its API

If rclone is run with the `--rc` flag then it starts an HTTP server
which can be used to remote control rclone using its API.

You can either use the [rclone rc](#api-rc) command to access the API
or [use HTTP directly](#api-http).

If you just want to run a remote control then see the [rcd command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_rcd/).

## Supported parameters

### --rc

Flag to start the http server listen on remote requests
      
### --rc-addr=IP

IPaddress:Port or :Port to bind server to. (default "localhost:5572")

### --rc-cert=KEY
SSL PEM key (concatenation of certificate and CA certificate)

### --rc-client-ca=PATH
Client certificate authority to verify clients with

### --rc-htpasswd=PATH

htpasswd file - if not provided no authentication is done

### --rc-key=PATH

SSL PEM Private key

### --rc-max-header-bytes=VALUE

Maximum size of request header (default 4096)

### --rc-user=VALUE

User name for authentication.

### --rc-pass=VALUE

Password for authentication.

### --rc-realm=VALUE

Realm for authentication (default "rclone")

### --rc-server-read-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server reading data (default 1h0m0s)

### --rc-server-write-timeout=DURATION

Timeout for server writing data (default 1h0m0s)

### --rc-serve

Enable the serving of remote objects via the HTTP interface.  This
means objects will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5572/ by default,
so you can browse to http://127.0.0.1:5572/ or http://127.0.0.1:5572/*
to see a listing of the remotes.  Objects may be requested from
remotes using this syntax http://127.0.0.1:5572/[remote:path]/path/to/object

Default Off.

### --rc-files /path/to/directory

Path to local files to serve on the HTTP server.

If this is set then rclone will serve the files in that directory.  It
will also open the root in the web browser if specified.  This is for
implementing browser based GUIs for rclone functions.

If `--rc-user` or `--rc-pass` is set then the URL that is opened will
have the authorization in the URL in the `http://user:pass@localhost/`
style.

Default Off.

### --rc-enable-metrics

Enable OpenMetrics/Prometheus compatible endpoint at `/metrics`.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui

Set this flag to serve the default web gui on the same port as rclone.

Default Off.

### --rc-allow-origin

Set the allowed Access-Control-Allow-Origin for rc requests.

Can be used with --rc-web-gui if the rclone is running on different IP than the web-gui.

Default is IP address on which rc is running.

### --rc-web-fetch-url

Set the URL to fetch the rclone-web-gui files from.

Default https://api.github.com/repos/rclone/rclone-webui-react/releases/latest.

### --rc-web-gui-update

Set this flag to check and update rclone-webui-react from the rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui-force-update

Set this flag to force update rclone-webui-react from the rc-web-fetch-url.

Default Off.

### --rc-web-gui-no-open-browser

Set this flag to disable opening browser automatically when using web-gui.

Default Off.

### --rc-job-expire-duration=DURATION

Expire finished async jobs older than DURATION (default 60s).

### --rc-job-expire-interval=DURATION

Interval duration to check for expired async jobs (default 10s).

### --rc-no-auth

By default rclone will require authorisation to have been set up on
the rc interface in order to use any methods which access any rclone
remotes.  Eg `operations/list` is denied as it involved creating a
remote as is `sync/copy`.

If this is set then no authorisation will be required on the server to
use these methods.  The alternative is to use `--rc-user` and
`--rc-pass` and use these credentials in the request.

Default Off.

## Accessing the remote control via the rclone rc command {#api-rc}

Rclone itself implements the remote control protocol in its `rclone
rc` command.

You can use it like this

```
$ rclone rc rc/noop param1=one param2=two
{
	"param1": "one",
	"param2": "two"
}
```

Run `rclone rc` on its own to see the help for the installed remote
control commands.

## JSON input

`rclone rc` also supports a `--json` flag which can be used to send
more complicated input parameters.

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 } }' rc/noop
{
	"p1": [
		1,
		"2",
		null,
		4
	],
	"p2": {
		"a": 1,
		"b": 2
	}
}
```

If the parameter being passed is an object then it can be passed as a
JSON string rather than using the `--json` flag which simplifies the
command line.

```
rclone rc operations/list fs=/tmp remote=test opt='{"showHash": true}'
```

Rather than

```
rclone rc operations/list --json '{"fs": "/tmp", "remote": "test", "opt": {"showHash": true}}'
```

## Special parameters

The rc interface supports some special parameters which apply to
**all** commands.  These start with `_` to show they are different.

### Running asynchronous jobs with _async = true

Each rc call is classified as a job and it is assigned its own id. By default
jobs are executed immediately as they are created or synchronously.

If `_async` has a true value when supplied to an rc call then it will
return immediately with a job id and the task will be run in the
background.  The `job/status` call can be used to get information of
the background job.  The job can be queried for up to 1 minute after
it has finished.

It is recommended that potentially long running jobs, e.g. `sync/sync`,
`sync/copy`, `sync/move`, `operations/purge` are run with the `_async`
flag to avoid any potential problems with the HTTP request and
response timing out.

Starting a job with the `_async` flag:

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "p1": [1,"2",null,4], "p2": { "a":1, "b":2 }, "_async": true }' rc/noop
{
	"jobid": 2
}
```

Query the status to see if the job has finished.  For more information
on the meaning of these return parameters see the `job/status` call.

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "jobid":2 }' job/status
{
	"duration": 0.000124163,
	"endTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911245881+01:00",
	"error": "",
	"finished": true,
	"id": 2,
	"output": {
		"_async": true,
		"p1": [
			1,
			"2",
			null,
			4
		],
		"p2": {
			"a": 1,
			"b": 2
		}
	},
	"startTime": "2018-10-27T11:38:07.911121728+01:00",
	"success": true
}
```

`job/list` can be used to show the running or recently completed jobs

```
$ rclone rc job/list
{
	"jobids": [
		2
	]
}
```

### Setting config flags with _config

If you wish to set config (the equivalent of the global flags) for the
duration of an rc call only then pass in the `_config` parameter.

This should be in the same format as the `config` key returned by
[options/get](#options-get).

For example, if you wished to run a sync with the `--checksum`
parameter, you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_config":{"CheckSum": true}

If using `rclone rc` this could be passed as

    rclone rc operations/sync ... _config='{"CheckSum": true}'

Any config parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers -
see [data types](/#data-types) for more info. Here is an example
setting the equivalent of `--buffer-size` in string or integer format.

    "_config":{"BufferSize": "42M"}
    "_config":{"BufferSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the `_config` assignment has worked properly then
calling `options/local` will show what the value got set to.

### Setting filter flags with _filter

If you wish to set filters for the duration of an rc call only then
pass in the `_filter` parameter.

This should be in the same format as the `filter` key returned by
[options/get](#options-get).

For example, if you wished to run a sync with these flags

    --max-size 1M --max-age 42s --include "a" --include "b"

you would pass this parameter in your JSON blob.

    "_filter":{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}

If using `rclone rc` this could be passed as

    rclone rc ... _filter='{"MaxSize":"1M", "IncludeRule":["a","b"], "MaxAge":"42s"}'

Any filter parameters you don't set will inherit the global defaults
which were set with command line flags or environment variables.

Note that it is possible to set some values as strings or integers -
see [data types](/#data-types) for more info. Here is an example
setting the equivalent of `--buffer-size` in string or integer format.

    "_filter":{"MinSize": "42M"}
    "_filter":{"MinSize": 44040192}

If you wish to check the `_filter` assignment has worked properly then
calling `options/local` will show what the value got set to.

### Assigning operations to groups with _group = value

Each rc call has its own stats group for tracking its metrics. By default
grouping is done by the composite group name from prefix `job/` and  id of the
job like so `job/1`.

If `_group` has a value then stats for that request will be grouped under that
value. This allows caller to group stats under their own name.

Stats for specific group can be accessed by passing `group` to `core/stats`:

```
$ rclone rc --json '{ "group": "job/1" }' core/stats
{
	"speed": 12345
	...
}
```

## Data types {#data-types}

When the API returns types, these will mostly be straight forward
integer, string or boolean types.

However some of the types returned by the [options/get](#options-get)
call and taken by the [options/set](#options-set) calls as well as the
`vfsOpt`, `mountOpt` and the `_config` parameters.

- `Duration` - these are returned as an integer duration in
  nanoseconds. They may be set as an integer, or they may be set with
  time string, eg "5s". See the [options section](https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for
  more info.
- `Size` - these are returned as an integer number of bytes. They may
  be set as an integer or they may be set with a size suffix string,
  eg "10M". See the [options section](https://rclone.org/docs/#options) for more info.
- Enumerated type (such as `CutoffMode`, `DumpFlags`, `LogLevel`,
  `VfsCacheMode` - these will be returned as an integer and may be set
  as an integer but more conveniently they can be set as a string, eg
  "HARD" for `CutoffMode` or `DEBUG` for `LogLevel`.
- `BandwidthSpec` - this will be set and returned as a string, eg
  "1M".

## Specifying remotes to work on

Remotes are specified with the `fs=`, `srcFs=`, `dstFs=`
parameters depending on the command being used.

The parameters can be a string as per the rest of rclone, eg
`s3:bucket/path` or `:sftp:/my/dir`. They can also be specified as
JSON blobs.

If specifyng a JSON blob it should be a object mapping strings to
strings. These values will be used to configure the remote. There are
3 special values which may be set:

- `type` -  set to `type` to specify a remote called `:type:`
- `_name` - set to `name` to specify a remote called `name:`
- `_root` - sets the root of the remote - may be empty

One of `_name` or `type` should normally be set. If the `local`
backend is desired then `type` should be set to `local`. If `_root`
isn't specified then it defaults to the root of the remote.

For example this JSON is equivalent to `remote:/tmp`

```
{
    "_name": "remote",
    "_path": "/tmp"
}
```

And this is equivalent to `:sftp,host='example.com':/tmp`

```
{
    "type": "sftp",
    "host": "example.com",
    "_path": "/tmp"
}
```

And this is equivalent to `/tmp/dir`

```
{
    type = "local",
    _ path = "/tmp/dir"
}
```

## Supported commands

### backend/command: Runs a backend command. {#backend-command}

This takes the following parameters:

- command - a string with the command name
- fs - a remote name string e.g. "drive:"
- arg - a list of arguments for the backend command
- opt - a map of string to string of options

Returns:

- result - result from the backend command

Example:

    rclone rc backend/command command=noop fs=. -o echo=yes -o blue -a path1 -a path2

Returns

```
{
	"result": {
		"arg": [
			"path1",
			"path2"
		],
		"name": "noop",
		"opt": {
			"blue": "",
			"echo": "yes"
		}
	}
}
```

Note that this is the direct equivalent of using this "backend"
command:

    rclone backend noop . -o echo=yes -o blue path1 path2

Note that arguments must be preceded by the "-a" flag

See the [backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command for more information.

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### cache/expire: Purge a remote from cache {#cache-expire}

Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file.
Params:
  - remote = path to remote (required)
  - withData = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well (optional)

Eg

    rclone rc cache/expire remote=path/to/sub/folder/
    rclone rc cache/expire remote=/ withData=true

### cache/fetch: Fetch file chunks {#cache-fetch}

Ensure the specified file chunks are cached on disk.

The chunks= parameter specifies the file chunks to check.
It takes a comma separated list of array slice indices.
The slice indices are similar to Python slices: start[:end]

start is the 0 based chunk number from the beginning of the file
to fetch inclusive. end is 0 based chunk number from the beginning
of the file to fetch exclusive.
Both values can be negative, in which case they count from the back
of the file. The value "-5:" represents the last 5 chunks of a file.

Some valid examples are:
":5,-5:" -> the first and last five chunks
"0,-2" -> the first and the second last chunk
"0:10" -> the first ten chunks

Any parameter with a key that starts with "file" can be used to
specify files to fetch, e.g.

    rclone rc cache/fetch chunks=0 file=hello file2=home/goodbye

File names will automatically be encrypted when the a crypt remote
is used on top of the cache.

### debug/set-block-profile-rate: Set runtime.SetBlockProfileRate for blocking profiling. {#debug-set-block-profile-rate}

SetBlockProfileRate controls the fraction of goroutine blocking events
that are reported in the blocking profile. The profiler aims to sample
an average of one blocking event per rate nanoseconds spent blocked.

To include every blocking event in the profile, pass rate = 1. To turn
off profiling entirely, pass rate <= 0.

After calling this you can use this to see the blocking profile:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block

Parameters:

- rate - int

### debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction: Set runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction for mutex profiling. {#debug-set-mutex-profile-fraction}

SetMutexProfileFraction controls the fraction of mutex contention
events that are reported in the mutex profile. On average 1/rate
events are reported. The previous rate is returned.

To turn off profiling entirely, pass rate 0. To just read the current
rate, pass rate < 0. (For n>1 the details of sampling may change.)

Once this is set you can look use this to profile the mutex contention:

    go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex

Parameters:

- rate - int

Results:

- previousRate - int

### fscache/clear: Clear the Fs cache. {#fscache-clear}

Returns:
- options - a list of the options block names

### options/get: Get all the global options {#options-get}

Returns an object where keys are option block names and values are an
object with the current option values in.

Note that these are the global options which are unaffected by use of
the _config and _filter parameters. If you wish to read the parameters
set in _config then use options/config and for _filter use options/filter.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

### options/local: Get the currently active config for this call {#options-local}

Returns an object with the keys "config" and "filter".
The "config" key contains the local config and the "filter" key contains
the local filters.

Note that these are the local options specific to this rc call. If
_config was not supplied then they will be the global options.
Likewise with "_filter".

This call is mostly useful for seeing if _config and _filter passing
is working.

This shows the internal names of the option within rclone which should
map to the external options very easily with a few exceptions.

### options/set: Set an option {#options-set}

Parameters:

- option block name containing an object with
  - key: value

Repeated as often as required.

Only supply the options you wish to change.  If an option is unknown
it will be silently ignored.  Not all options will have an effect when
changed like this.

For example:

This sets DEBUG level logs (-vv) (these can be set by number or string)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "DEBUG"}}'
    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": 8}}'

And this sets INFO level logs (-v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "INFO"}}'

And this sets NOTICE level logs (normal without -v)

    rclone rc options/set --json '{"main": {"LogLevel": "NOTICE"}}'

**Authentication is required for this call.**

### vfs/forget: Forget files or directories in the directory cache. {#vfs-forget}

This forgets the paths in the directory cache causing them to be
re-read from the remote when needed.

If no paths are passed in then it will forget all the paths in the
directory cache.

    rclone rc vfs/forget

Otherwise pass files or dirs in as file=path or dir=path.  Any
parameter key starting with file will forget that file and any
starting with dir will forget that dir, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/forget file=hello file2=goodbye dir=home/junk
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/list: List active VFSes. {#vfs-list}

This lists the active VFSes.

It returns a list under the key "vfses" where the values are the VFS
names that could be passed to the other VFS commands in the "fs"
parameter.

### vfs/poll-interval: Get the status or update the value of the poll-interval option. {#vfs-poll-interval}

Without any parameter given this returns the current status of the
poll-interval setting.

When the interval=duration parameter is set, the poll-interval value
is updated and the polling function is notified.
Setting interval=0 disables poll-interval.

    rclone rc vfs/poll-interval interval=5m

The timeout=duration parameter can be used to specify a time to wait
for the current poll function to apply the new value.
If timeout is less or equal 0, which is the default, wait indefinitely.

The new poll-interval value will only be active when the timeout is
not reached.

If poll-interval is updated or disabled temporarily, some changes
might not get picked up by the polling function, depending on the
used remote.
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.

### vfs/refresh: Refresh the directory cache. {#vfs-refresh}

This reads the directories for the specified paths and freshens the
directory cache.

If no paths are passed in then it will refresh the root directory.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh

Otherwise pass directories in as dir=path. Any parameter key
starting with dir will refresh that directory, e.g.

    rclone rc vfs/refresh dir=home/junk dir2=data/misc

If the parameter recursive=true is given the whole directory tree
will get refreshed. This refresh will use --fast-list if enabled.
 
This command takes an "fs" parameter. If this parameter is not
supplied and if there is only one VFS in use then that VFS will be
used. If there is more than one VFS in use then the "fs" parameter
must be supplied.



## Accessing the remote control via HTTP {#api-http}

Rclone implements a simple HTTP based protocol.

Each endpoint takes an JSON object and returns a JSON object or an
error.  The JSON objects are essentially a map of string names to
values.

All calls must made using POST.

The input objects can be supplied using URL parameters, POST
parameters or by supplying "Content-Type: application/json" and a JSON
blob in the body.  There are examples of these below using `curl`.

The response will be a JSON blob in the body of the response.  This is
formatted to be reasonably human readable.

### Error returns

If an error occurs then there will be an HTTP error status (e.g. 500)
and the body of the response will contain a JSON encoded error object,
e.g.

```
{
    "error": "Expecting string value for key \"remote\" (was float64)",
    "input": {
        "fs": "/tmp",
        "remote": 3
    },
    "status": 400
    "path": "operations/rmdir",
}
```

The keys in the error response are
- error - error string
- input - the input parameters to the call
- status - the HTTP status code
- path - the path of the call

### CORS

The sever implements basic CORS support and allows all origins for that.
The response to a preflight OPTIONS request will echo the requested "Access-Control-Request-Headers" back.

### Using POST with URL parameters only

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?potato=1&sausage=2'
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"sausage": "2"
}
```

Here is what an error response looks like:

```
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
```

```
{
	"error": "arbitrary error on input map[potato:1 sausage:2]",
	"input": {
		"potato": "1",
		"sausage": "2"
	}
}
```

Note that curl doesn't return errors to the shell unless you use the `-f` option

```
$ curl -f -X POST 'http://localhost:5572/rc/error?potato=1&sausage=2'
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request
$ echo $?
22
```

### Using POST with a form

```
curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" http://localhost:5572/rc/noop
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"sausage": "2"
}
```

Note that you can combine these with URL parameters too with the POST
parameters taking precedence.

```
curl --data "potato=1" --data "sausage=2" "http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&sausage=4"
```

Response

```
{
	"potato": "1",
	"rutabaga": "3",
	"sausage": "4"
}

```

### Using POST with a JSON blob

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' http://localhost:5572/rc/noop
```

response

```
{
	"password": "xyz",
	"username": "xyz"
}
```

This can be combined with URL parameters too if required.  The JSON
blob takes precedence.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"potato":2,"sausage":1}' 'http://localhost:5572/rc/noop?rutabaga=3&potato=4'
```

```
{
	"potato": 2,
	"rutabaga": "3",
	"sausage": 1
}
```

## Debugging rclone with pprof ##

If you use the `--rc` flag this will also enable the use of the go
profiling tools on the same port.

To use these, first [install go](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Debugging memory use

To profile rclone's memory use you can run:

    go tool pprof -web http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

This should open a page in your browser showing what is using what
memory.

You can also use the `-text` flag to produce a textual summary

```
$ go tool pprof -text http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap

### Debugging go routine leaks

Memory leaks are most often caused by go routine leaks keeping memory
alive which should have been garbage collected.

See all active go routines using

    curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1

Or go to http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1 in your browser.

### Other profiles to look at

You can see a summary of profiles available at http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/

Here is how to use some of them:

- Memory: `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/heap`
- Go routines: `curl http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=1`
- 30-second CPU profile: `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/profile`
- 5-second execution trace: `wget http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/trace?seconds=5`
- Goroutine blocking profile
    - Enable first with: `rclone rc debug/set-block-profile-rate rate=1` ([docs](#debug/set-block-profile-rate))
    - `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/block`
- Contended mutexes:
    - Enable first with: `rclone rc debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction rate=1` ([docs](#debug/set-mutex-profile-fraction))
    - `go tool pprof http://localhost:5572/debug/pprof/mutex`

See the [net/http/pprof docs](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
for more info on how to use the profiling and for a general overview
see [the Go team's blog post on profiling go programs](https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs).

The profiling hook is [zero overhead unless it is used](https://stackoverflow.com/q/26545159/164234).

# Overview of cloud storage systems #

Each cloud storage system is slightly different.  Rclone attempts to
provide a unified interface to them, but some underlying differences
show through.

### Notes

¹ Dropbox supports [its own custom
hash](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash).
This is an SHA256 sum of all the 4 MiB block SHA256s.

² SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and
`md5sum` or `sha1sum` as well as `echo` are in the remote's PATH.

³ WebDAV supports hashes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

⁴ WebDAV supports modtimes when used with Owncloud and Nextcloud only.

⁵ Microsoft OneDrive Personal supports SHA1 hashes, whereas OneDrive
for business and SharePoint server support Microsoft's own
[QuickXorHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).

⁶ Mail.ru uses its own modified SHA1 hash

⁷ pCloud only supports SHA1 (not MD5) in its EU region

⁸ Opendrive does not support creation of duplicate files using
their web client interface or other stock clients, but the underlying
storage platform has been determined to allow duplicate files, and it
is possible to create them with `rclone`.  It may be that this is a
mistake or an unsupported feature.

### Hash ###

The cloud storage system supports various hash types of the objects.
The hashes are used when transferring data as an integrity check and
can be specifically used with the `--checksum` flag in syncs and in
the `check` command.

To use the verify checksums when transferring between cloud storage
systems they must support a common hash type.

### ModTime ###

The cloud storage system supports setting modification times on
objects.  If it does then this enables a using the modification times
as part of the sync.  If not then only the size will be checked by
default, though the MD5SUM can be checked with the `--checksum` flag.

All cloud storage systems support some kind of date on the object and
these will be set when transferring from the cloud storage system.

### Case Insensitive ###

If a cloud storage systems is case sensitive then it is possible to
have two files which differ only in case, e.g. `file.txt` and
`FILE.txt`.  If a cloud storage system is case insensitive then that
isn't possible.

This can cause problems when syncing between a case insensitive
system and a case sensitive system.  The symptom of this is that no
matter how many times you run the sync it never completes fully.

The local filesystem and SFTP may or may not be case sensitive
depending on OS.

  * Windows - usually case insensitive, though case is preserved
  * OSX - usually case insensitive, though it is possible to format case sensitive
  * Linux - usually case sensitive, but there are case insensitive file systems (e.g. FAT formatted USB keys)

Most of the time this doesn't cause any problems as people tend to
avoid files whose name differs only by case even on case sensitive
systems.

### Duplicate files ###

If a cloud storage system allows duplicate files then it can have two
objects with the same name.

This confuses rclone greatly when syncing - use the `rclone dedupe`
command to rename or remove duplicates.

### Restricted filenames ###

Some cloud storage systems might have restrictions on the characters
that are usable in file or directory names.
When `rclone` detects such a name during a file upload, it will
transparently replace the restricted characters with similar looking
Unicode characters. To handle the different sets of restricted characters
for different backends, rclone uses something it calls [encoding](#encoding).

This process is designed to avoid ambiguous file names as much as
possible and allow to move files between many cloud storage systems
transparently.

The name shown by `rclone` to the user or during log output will only
contain a minimal set of [replaced characters](#restricted-characters)
to ensure correct formatting and not necessarily the actual name used
on the cloud storage.

This transformation is reversed when downloading a file or parsing
`rclone` arguments. For example, when uploading a file named `my file?.txt`
to Onedrive, it will be displayed as `my file?.txt` on the console, but
stored as `my file？.txt` to Onedrive (the `?` gets replaced by the similar
looking `？` character, the so-called "fullwidth question mark").
The reverse transformation allows to read a file `unusual/name.txt`
from Google Drive, by passing the name `unusual／name.txt` on the command line
(the `/` needs to be replaced by the similar looking `／` character).

#### Caveats {#restricted-filenames-caveats}

The filename encoding system works well in most cases, at least
where file names are written in English or similar languages.
You might not even notice it: It just works. In some cases it may
lead to issues, though. E.g. when file names are written in Chinese,
or Japanese, where it is always the Unicode fullwidth variants of the
punctuation marks that are used.

On Windows, the characters `:`, `*` and `?` are examples of restricted
characters. If these are used in filenames on a remote that supports it,
Rclone will transparently convert them to their fullwidth Unicode
variants `＊`, `？` and `：` when downloading to Windows, and back again
when uploading. This way files with names that are not allowed on Windows
can still be stored.

However, if you have files on your Windows system originally with these same
Unicode characters in their names, they will be included in the same conversion
process. E.g. if you create a file in your Windows filesystem with name
`Test：1.jpg`, where `：` is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol, and use
rclone to upload it to Google Drive, which supports regular `:` (halfwidth
question mark), rclone will replace the fullwidth `:` with the
halfwidth `:` and store the file as `Test:1.jpg` in Google Drive. Since
both Windows and Google Drive allows the name `Test：1.jpg`, it would
probably be better if rclone just kept the name as is in this case.

With the opposite situation; if you have a file named `Test:1.jpg`,
in your Google Drive, e.g. uploaded from a Linux system where `:` is valid
in file names. Then later use rclone to copy this file to your Windows
computer you will notice that on your local disk it gets renamed
to `Test：1.jpg`. The original filename is not legal on Windows, due to
the `:`, and rclone therefore renames it to make the copy possible.
That is all good. However, this can also lead to an issue: If you already
had a *different* file named `Test：1.jpg` on Windows, and then use rclone
to copy either way. Rclone will then treat the file originally named
`Test:1.jpg` on Google Drive and the file originally named `Test：1.jpg`
on Windows as the same file, and replace the contents from one with the other.

Its virtually impossible to handle all cases like these correctly in all
situations, but by customizing the [encoding option](#encoding), changing the
set of characters that rclone should convert, you should be able to
create a configuration that works well for your specific situation.
See also the [example](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding-example-windows) below.

(Windows was used as an example of a file system with many restricted
characters, and Google drive a storage system with few.)

#### Default restricted characters {#restricted-characters}

The table below shows the characters that are replaced by default.

When a replacement character is found in a filename, this character
will be escaped with the `‛` character to avoid ambiguous file names.
(e.g. a file named `␀.txt` would shown as `‛␀.txt`)

Each cloud storage backend can use a different set of characters,
which will be specified in the documentation for each backend.

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| SOH       | 0x01  | ␁           |
| STX       | 0x02  | ␂           |
| ETX       | 0x03  | ␃           |
| EOT       | 0x04  | ␄           |
| ENQ       | 0x05  | ␅           |
| ACK       | 0x06  | ␆           |
| BEL       | 0x07  | ␇           |
| BS        | 0x08  | ␈           |
| HT        | 0x09  | ␉           |
| LF        | 0x0A  | ␊           |
| VT        | 0x0B  | ␋           |
| FF        | 0x0C  | ␌           |
| CR        | 0x0D  | ␍           |
| SO        | 0x0E  | ␎           |
| SI        | 0x0F  | ␏           |
| DLE       | 0x10  | ␐           |
| DC1       | 0x11  | ␑           |
| DC2       | 0x12  | ␒           |
| DC3       | 0x13  | ␓           |
| DC4       | 0x14  | ␔           |
| NAK       | 0x15  | ␕           |
| SYN       | 0x16  | ␖           |
| ETB       | 0x17  | ␗           |
| CAN       | 0x18  | ␘           |
| EM        | 0x19  | ␙           |
| SUB       | 0x1A  | ␚           |
| ESC       | 0x1B  | ␛           |
| FS        | 0x1C  | ␜           |
| GS        | 0x1D  | ␝           |
| RS        | 0x1E  | ␞           |
| US        | 0x1F  | ␟           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |
| DEL       | 0x7F  | ␡           |

The default encoding will also encode these file names as they are
problematic with many cloud storage systems.

| File name | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----------:|
| .         | ．          |
| ..        | ．．         |

#### Invalid UTF-8 bytes {#invalid-utf8}

Some backends only support a sequence of well formed UTF-8 bytes
as file or directory names.

In this case all invalid UTF-8 bytes will be replaced with a quoted
representation of the byte value to allow uploading a file to such a
backend. For example, the invalid byte `0xFE` will be encoded as `‛FE`.

A common source of invalid UTF-8 bytes are local filesystems, that store
names in a different encoding than UTF-8 or UTF-16, like latin1. See the
[local filenames](https://rclone.org/local/#filenames) section for details.

#### Encoding option {#encoding}

Most backends have an encoding option, specified as a flag
`--backend-encoding` where `backend` is the name of the backend, or as
a config parameter `encoding` (you'll need to select the Advanced
config in `rclone config` to see it).

This will have default value which encodes and decodes characters in
such a way as to preserve the maximum number of characters (see
above).

However this can be incorrect in some scenarios, for example if you
have a Windows file system with Unicode fullwidth characters
`＊`, `？` or `：`, that you want to remain as those characters on the
remote rather than being translated to regular (halfwidth) `*`, `?` and `:`.

The `--backend-encoding` flags allow you to change that. You can
disable the encoding completely with `--backend-encoding None` or set
`encoding = None` in the config file.

Encoding takes a comma separated list of encodings. You can see the
list of all possible values by passing an invalid value to this
flag, e.g. `--local-encoding "help"`. The command `rclone help flags encoding`
will show you the defaults for the backends.

| Encoding  | Characters |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Asterisk | `*` |
| BackQuote | `` ` `` |
| BackSlash | `\` |
| Colon | `:` |
| CrLf | CR 0x0D, LF 0x0A |
| Ctl | All control characters 0x00-0x1F |
| Del | DEL 0x7F |
| Dollar | `$` |
| Dot | `.` or `..` as entire string |
| DoubleQuote | `"` |
| Hash | `#` |
| InvalidUtf8 | An invalid UTF-8 character (e.g. latin1) |
| LeftCrLfHtVt | CR 0x0D, LF 0x0A,HT 0x09, VT 0x0B on the left of a string |
| LeftPeriod | `.` on the left of a string |
| LeftSpace | SPACE on the left of a string |
| LeftTilde | `~` on the left of a string |
| LtGt | `<`, `>` |
| None | No characters are encoded |
| Percent | `%` |
| Pipe | \| |
| Question | `?` |
| RightCrLfHtVt | CR 0x0D, LF 0x0A, HT 0x09, VT 0x0B on the right of a string |
| RightPeriod | `.` on the right of a string |
| RightSpace | SPACE on the right of a string |
| SingleQuote | `'` |
| Slash | `/` |
| SquareBracket | `[`, `]` |

##### Encoding example: FTP

To take a specific example, the FTP backend's default encoding is

    --ftp-encoding "Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot"

However, let's say the FTP server is running on Windows and can't have
any of the invalid Windows characters in file names. You are backing
up Linux servers to this FTP server which do have those characters in
file names. So you would add the Windows set which are

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot

to the existing ones, giving:

    Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot,Del,RightSpace

This can be specified using the `--ftp-encoding` flag or using an `encoding` parameter in the config file.

##### Encoding example: Windows

As a nother example, take a Windows system where there is a file with
name `Test：1.jpg`, where `：` is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol.
When using rclone to copy this to a remote which supports `:`,
the regular (halfwidth) colon (such as Google Drive), you will notice
that the file gets renamed to `Test:1.jpg`.

To avoid this you can change the set of characters rclone should convert
for the local filesystem, using command-line argument `--local-encoding`.
Rclone's default behavior on Windows corresponds to

```
--local-encoding "Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot"
```

If you want to use fullwidth characters `：`, `＊` and `？` in your filenames
without rclone changing them when uploading to a remote, then set the same as
the default value but without `Colon,Question,Asterisk`:

```
--local-encoding "Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot"
```

Alternatively, you can disable the conversion of any characters with `--local-encoding None`.

Instead of using command-line argument `--local-encoding`, you may also set it
as [environment variable](https://rclone.org/docs/#environment-variables) `RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING`,
or [configure](https://rclone.org/docs/#configure) a remote of type `local` in your config,
and set the `encoding` option there.

The risk by doing this is that if you have a filename with the regular (halfwidth)
`:`, `*` and `?` in your cloud storage, and you try to download
it to your Windows filesystem, this will fail. These characters are not
valid in filenames on Windows, and you have told rclone not to work around
this by converting them to valid fullwidth variants.

### MIME Type ###

MIME types (also known as media types) classify types of documents
using a simple text classification, e.g. `text/html` or
`application/pdf`.

Some cloud storage systems support reading (`R`) the MIME type of
objects and some support writing (`W`) the MIME type of objects.

The MIME type can be important if you are serving files directly to
HTTP from the storage system.

If you are copying from a remote which supports reading (`R`) to a
remote which supports writing (`W`) then rclone will preserve the MIME
types.  Otherwise they will be guessed from the extension, or the
remote itself may assign the MIME type.

## Optional Features ##

All rclone remotes support a base command set. Other features depend
upon backend specific capabilities.

### Purge ###

This deletes a directory quicker than just deleting all the files in
the directory.

† Note Swift, Hubic, and Tardigrade implement this in order to delete
directory markers but they don't actually have a quicker way of deleting
files other than deleting them individually.

‡ StreamUpload is not supported with Nextcloud

### Copy ###

Used when copying an object to and from the same remote.  This known
as a server-side copy so you can copy a file without downloading it
and uploading it again.  It is used if you use `rclone copy` or
`rclone move` if the remote doesn't support `Move` directly.

If the server doesn't support `Copy` directly then for copy operations
the file is downloaded then re-uploaded.

### Move ###

Used when moving/renaming an object on the same remote.  This is known
as a server-side move of a file.  This is used in `rclone move` if the
server doesn't support `DirMove`.

If the server isn't capable of `Move` then rclone simulates it with
`Copy` then delete.  If the server doesn't support `Copy` then rclone
will download the file and re-upload it.

### DirMove ###

This is used to implement `rclone move` to move a directory if
possible.  If it isn't then it will use `Move` on each file (which
falls back to `Copy` then download and upload - see `Move` section).

### CleanUp ###

This is used for emptying the trash for a remote by `rclone cleanup`.

If the server can't do `CleanUp` then `rclone cleanup` will return an
error.

‡‡ Note that while Box implements this it has to delete every file
individually so it will be slower than emptying the trash via the WebUI

### ListR ###

The remote supports a recursive list to list all the contents beneath
a directory quickly.  This enables the `--fast-list` flag to work.
See the [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### StreamUpload ###

Some remotes allow files to be uploaded without knowing the file size
in advance. This allows certain operations to work without spooling the
file to local disk first, e.g. `rclone rcat`.

### LinkSharing ###

Sets the necessary permissions on a file or folder and prints a link
that allows others to access them, even if they don't have an account
on the particular cloud provider.

### About ###

Rclone `about` prints quota information for a remote. Typical output
includes bytes used, free, quota and in trash.

If a remote lacks about capability `rclone about remote:`returns
an error.

Backends without about capability cannot determine free space for an
rclone mount, or use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an
rclone union remote.

See [rclone about command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

### EmptyDir ###

The remote supports empty directories. See [Limitations](https://rclone.org/bugs/#limitations)
 for details. Most Object/Bucket based remotes do not support this.

# Docker Volume Plugin

## Introduction

Docker 1.9 has added support for creating
[named volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) via
[command-line interface](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/)
and mounting them in containers as a way to share data between them.
Since Docker 1.10 you can create named volumes with
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) by descriptions in
[docker-compose.yml](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference)
files for use by container groups on a single host.
As of Docker 1.12 volumes are supported by
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/key-concepts/)
included with Docker Engine and created from descriptions in
[swarm compose v3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference)
files for use with _swarm stacks_ across multiple cluster nodes.

[Docker Volume Plugins](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/)
augment the default `local` volume driver included in Docker with stateful
volumes shared across containers and hosts. Unlike local volumes, your
data will _not_ be deleted when such volume is removed. Plugins can run
managed by the docker daemon, as a native system service
(under systemd, _sysv_ or _upstart_) or as a standalone executable.
Rclone can run as docker volume plugin in all these modes.
It interacts with the local docker daemon
via [plugin API](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugin_api/) and
handles mounting of remote file systems into docker containers so it must
run on the same host as the docker daemon or on every Swarm node.

## Getting started

In the first example we will use the [SFTP](https://rclone.org/sftp/)
rclone volume with Docker engine on a standalone Ubuntu machine.

Start from [installing Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
on the host.

The _FUSE_ driver is a prerequisite for rclone mounting and should be
installed on host:
```
sudo apt-get -y install fuse
```

Create two directories required by rclone docker plugin:
```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache
```

Install the managed rclone docker plugin for your architecture (here `amd64`):
```
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 args="-v" --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions
docker plugin list
```

Create your [SFTP volume](https://rclone.org/sftp/#standard-options):
```
docker volume create firstvolume -d rclone -o type=sftp -o sftp-host=_hostname_ -o sftp-user=_username_ -o sftp-pass=_password_ -o allow-other=true
```

Note that since all options are static, you don't even have to run
`rclone config` or create the `rclone.conf` file (but the `config` directory
should still be present). In the simplest case you can use `localhost`
as _hostname_ and your SSH credentials as _username_ and _password_.
You can also change the remote path to your home directory on the host,
for example `-o path=/home/username`.


Time to create a test container and mount the volume into it:
```
docker run --rm -it -v firstvolume:/mnt --workdir /mnt ubuntu:latest bash
```

If all goes well, you will enter the new container and change right to
the mounted SFTP remote. You can type `ls` to list the mounted directory
or otherwise play with it. Type `exit` when you are done.
The container will stop but the volume will stay, ready to be reused.
When it's not needed anymore, remove it:
```
docker volume list
docker volume remove firstvolume
```

Now let us try **something more elaborate**:
[Google Drive](https://rclone.org/drive/) volume on multi-node Docker Swarm.

You should start from installing Docker and FUSE, creating plugin
directories and installing rclone plugin on _every_ swarm node.
Then [setup the Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-mode/).

Google Drive volumes need an access token which can be setup via web
browser and will be periodically renewed by rclone. The managed
plugin cannot run a browser so we will use a technique similar to the
[rclone setup on a headless box](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).

Run [rclone config](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config_create/)
on _another_ machine equipped with _web browser_ and graphical user interface.
Create the [Google Drive remote](https://rclone.org/drive/#standard-options).
When done, transfer the resulting `rclone.conf` to the Swarm cluster
and save as `/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config/rclone.conf`
on _every_ node. By default this location is accessible only to the
root user so you will need appropriate privileges. The resulting config
will look like this:
```
[gdrive]
type = drive
scope = drive
drive_id = 1234567...
root_folder_id = 0Abcd...
token = {"access_token":...}
```

Now create the file named `example.yml` with a swarm stack description
like this:
```
version: '3'
services:
  heimdall:
    image: linuxserver/heimdall:latest
    ports: [8080:80]
    volumes: [configdata:/config]
volumes:
  configdata:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: 'gdrive:heimdall'
      allow_other: 'true'
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      poll_interval: 0
```

and run the stack:
```
docker stack deploy example -c ./example.yml
```

After a few seconds docker will spread the parsed stack description
over cluster, create the `example_heimdall` service on port _8080_,
run service containers on one or more cluster nodes and request
the `example_configdata` volume from rclone plugins on the node hosts.
You can use the following commands to confirm results:
```
docker service ls
docker service ps example_heimdall
docker volume ls
```

Point your browser to `http://cluster.host.address:8080` and play with
the service. Stop it with `docker stack remove example` when you are done.
Note that the `example_configdata` volume(s) created on demand at the
cluster nodes will not be automatically removed together with the stack
but stay for future reuse. You can remove them manually by invoking
the `docker volume remove example_configdata` command on every node.

## Creating Volumes via CLI

Volumes can be created with [docker volume create](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_create/).
Here are a few examples:
```
docker volume create vol1 -d rclone -o remote=storj: -o vfs-cache-mode=full
docker volume create vol2 -d rclone -o remote=:tardigrade,access_grant=xxx:heimdall
docker volume create vol3 -d rclone -o type=tardigrade -o path=heimdall -o tardigrade-access-grant=xxx -o poll-interval=0
```

Note the `-d rclone` flag that tells docker to request volume from the
rclone driver. This works even if you installed managed driver by its full
name `rclone/docker-volume-rclone` because you provided the `--alias rclone`
option.

Volumes can be inspected as follows:
```
docker volume list
docker volume inspect vol1
```

## Volume Configuration

Rclone flags and volume options are set via the `-o` flag to the
`docker volume create` command. They include backend-specific parameters
as well as mount and _VFS_ options. Also there are a few
special `-o` options:
`remote`, `fs`, `type`, `path`, `mount-type` and `persist`.

`remote` determines an existing remote name from the config file, with
trailing colon and optionally with a remote path. See the full syntax in
the [rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/docs/#syntax-of-remote-paths).
This option can be aliased as `fs` to prevent confusion with the
_remote_ parameter of such backends as _crypt_ or _alias_.

The `remote=:backend:dir/subdir` syntax can be used to create
[on-the-fly (config-less) remotes](https://rclone.org/docs/#backend-path-to-dir),
while the `type` and `path` options provide a simpler alternative for this.
Using two split options
```
-o type=backend -o path=dir/subdir
```
is equivalent to the combined syntax
```
-o remote=:backend:dir/subdir
```
but is arguably easier to parameterize in scripts.
The `path` part is optional.

[Mount and VFS options](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options)
as well as [backend parameters](https://rclone.org/flags/#backend-flags) are named
like their twin command-line flags without the `--` CLI prefix.
Optionally you can use underscores instead of dashes in option names.
For example, `--vfs-cache-mode full` becomes
`-o vfs-cache-mode=full` or `-o vfs_cache_mode=full`.
Boolean CLI flags without value will gain the `true` value, e.g.
`--allow-other` becomes `-o allow-other=true` or `-o allow_other=true`.

Please note that you can provide parameters only for the backend immediately
referenced by the backend type of mounted `remote`.
If this is a wrapping backend like _alias, chunker or crypt_, you cannot
provide options for the referred to remote or backend. This limitation is
imposed by the rclone connection string parser. The only workaround is to
feed plugin with `rclone.conf` or configure plugin arguments (see below).

## Special Volume Options

`mount-type` determines the mount method and in general can be one of:
`mount`, `cmount`, or `mount2`. This can be aliased as `mount_type`.
It should be noted that the managed rclone docker plugin currently does
not support the `cmount` method and `mount2` is rarely needed.
This option defaults to the first found method, which is usually `mount`
so you generally won't need it.

`persist` is a reserved boolean (true/false) option.
In future it will allow to persist on-the-fly remotes in the plugin
`rclone.conf` file.

## Connection Strings

The `remote` value can be extended
with [connection strings](https://rclone.org/docs/#connection-strings)
as an alternative way to supply backend parameters. This is equivalent
to the `-o` backend options with one _syntactic difference_.
Inside connection string the backend prefix must be dropped from parameter
names but in the `-o param=value` array it must be present.
For instance, compare the following option array
```
-o remote=:sftp:/home -o sftp-host=localhost
```
with equivalent connection string:
```
-o remote=:sftp,host=localhost:/home
```
This difference exists because flag options `-o key=val` include not only
backend parameters but also mount/VFS flags and possibly other settings.
Also it allows to discriminate the `remote` option from the `crypt-remote`
(or similarly named backend parameters) and arguably simplifies scripting
due to clearer value substitution.

## Using with Swarm or Compose

Both _Docker Swarm_ and _Docker Compose_ use
[YAML](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)-formatted text files to describe
groups (stacks) of containers, their properties, networks and volumes.
_Compose_ uses the [compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volume-configuration-reference) format,
_Swarm_ uses the [compose v3](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#volume-configuration-reference) format.
They are mostly similar, differences are explained in the
[docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#upgrading).

Volumes are described by the children of the top-level `volumes:` node.
Each of them should be named after its volume and have at least two
elements, the self-explanatory `driver: rclone` value and the
`driver_opts:` structure playing the same role as `-o key=val` CLI flags:

```
volumes:
  volume_name_1:
    driver: rclone
    driver_opts:
      remote: 'gdrive:'
      allow_other: 'true'
      vfs_cache_mode: full
      token: '{"type": "borrower", "expires": "2021-12-31"}'
      poll_interval: 0
```

Notice a few important details:
- YAML prefers `_` in option names instead of `-`.
- YAML treats single and double quotes interchangeably.
  Simple strings and integers can be left unquoted.
- Boolean values must be quoted like `'true'` or `"false"` because
  these two words are reserved by YAML.
- The filesystem string is keyed with `remote` (or with `fs`).
  Normally you can omit quotes here, but if the string ends with colon,
  you **must** quote it like `remote: "storage_box:"`.
- YAML is picky about surrounding braces in values as this is in fact
  another [syntax for key/value mappings](http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2790832).
  For example, JSON access tokens usually contain double quotes and
  surrounding braces, so you must put them in single quotes.

## Installing as Managed Plugin

Docker daemon can install plugins from an image registry and run them managed.
We maintain the
[docker-volume-rclone](https://hub.docker.com/p/rclone/docker-volume-rclone/)
plugin image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).

Rclone volume plugin requires **Docker Engine >= 19.03.15**

The plugin requires presence of two directories on the host before it can
be installed. Note that plugin will **not** create them automatically.
By default they must exist on host at the following locations
(though you can tweak the paths):
- `/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config`
  is reserved for the `rclone.conf` config file and **must** exist
  even if it's empty and the config file is not present.
- `/var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache`
  holds the plugin state file as well as optional VFS caches.

You can [install managed plugin](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_install/)
with default settings as follows:
```
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 --grant-all-permissions --alias rclone
```

The `:amd64` part of the image specification after colon is called a _tag_.
Usually you will want to install the latest plugin for your architecture. In
this case the tag will just name it, like `amd64` above. The following plugin
architectures are currently available:
- `amd64`
- `arm64`
- `arm-v7`

Sometimes you might want a concrete plugin version, not the latest one.
Then you should use image tag in the form `:ARCHITECTURE-VERSION`.
For example, to install plugin version `v1.56.2` on architecture `arm64`
you will use tag `arm64-1.56.2` (note the removed `v`) so the full image
specification becomes `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:arm64-1.56.2`.

We also provide the `latest` plugin tag, but since docker does not support
multi-architecture plugins as of the time of this writing, this tag is
currently an **alias for `amd64`**.
By convention the `latest` tag is the default one and can be omitted, thus
both `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:latest` and just `rclone/docker-volume-rclone`
will refer to the latest plugin release for the `amd64` platform.

Also the `amd64` part can be omitted from the versioned rclone plugin tags.
For example, rclone image reference `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64-1.56.2`
can be abbreviated as `rclone/docker-volume-rclone:1.56.2` for convenience.
However, for non-intel architectures you still have to use the full tag as
`amd64` or `latest` will fail to start.

Managed plugin is in fact a special container running in a namespace separate
from normal docker containers. Inside it runs the `rclone serve docker`
command. The config and cache directories are bind-mounted into the
container at start. The docker daemon connects to a unix socket created
by the command inside the container. The command creates on-demand remote
mounts right inside, then docker machinery propagates them through kernel
mount namespaces and bind-mounts into requesting user containers.

You can tweak a few plugin settings after installation when it's disabled
(not in use), for instance:
```
docker plugin disable rclone
docker plugin set rclone RCLONE_VERBOSE=2 config=/etc/rclone args="--vfs-cache-mode=writes --allow-other"
docker plugin enable rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone
```

Note that if docker refuses to disable the plugin, you should find and
remove all active volumes connected with it as well as containers and
swarm services that use them. This is rather tedious so please carefully
plan in advance.

You can tweak the following settings:
`args`, `config`, `cache`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`
and `RCLONE_VERBOSE`.
It's _your_ task to keep plugin settings in sync across swarm cluster nodes.

`args` sets command-line arguments for the `rclone serve docker` command
(_none_ by default). Arguments should be separated by space so you will
normally want to put them in quotes on the
[docker plugin set](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/plugin_set/)
command line. Both [serve docker flags](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_serve_docker/#options)
and [generic rclone flags](https://rclone.org/flags/) are supported, including backend
parameters that will be used as defaults for volume creation.
Note that plugin will fail (due to [this docker bug](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v20.10.7/plugin/v2/plugin.go#L195))
if the `args` value is empty. Use e.g. `args="-v"` as a workaround.

`config=/host/dir` sets alternative host location for the config directory.
Plugin will look for `rclone.conf` here. It's not an error if the config
file is not present but the directory must exist. Please note that plugin
can periodically rewrite the config file, for example when it renews
storage access tokens. Keep this in mind and try to avoid races between
the plugin and other instances of rclone on the host that might try to
change the config simultaneously resulting in corrupted `rclone.conf`.
You can also put stuff like private key files for SFTP remotes in this
directory. Just note that it's bind-mounted inside the plugin container
at the predefined path `/data/config`. For example, if your key file is
named `sftp-box1.key` on the host, the corresponding volume config option
should read `-o sftp-key-file=/data/config/sftp-box1.key`.

`cache=/host/dir` sets alternative host location for the _cache_ directory.
The plugin will keep VFS caches here. Also it will create and maintain
the `docker-plugin.state` file in this directory. When the plugin is
restarted or reinstalled, it will look in this file to recreate any volumes
that existed previously. However, they will not be re-mounted into
consuming containers after restart. Usually this is not a problem as
the docker daemon normally will restart affected user containers after
failures, daemon restarts or host reboots.

`RCLONE_VERBOSE` sets plugin verbosity from `0` (errors only, by default)
to `2` (debugging). Verbosity can be also tweaked via `args="-v [-v] ..."`.
Since arguments are more generic, you will rarely need this setting.
The plugin output by default feeds the docker daemon log on local host.
Log entries are reflected as _errors_ in the docker log but retain their
actual level assigned by rclone in the encapsulated message string.

`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` customize the plugin proxy settings.

You can set custom plugin options right when you install it, _in one go_:
```
docker plugin remove rclone
docker plugin install rclone/docker-volume-rclone:amd64 \
       --alias rclone --grant-all-permissions \
       args="-v --allow-other" config=/etc/rclone
docker plugin inspect rclone
```

## Healthchecks

The docker plugin volume protocol doesn't provide a way for plugins
to inform the docker daemon that a volume is (un-)available.
As a workaround you can setup a healthcheck to verify that the mount
is responding, for example:
```
services:
  my_service:
    image: my_image
    healthcheck:
      test: ls /path/to/rclone/mount || exit 1
      interval: 1m
      timeout: 15s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s
```

## Running Plugin under Systemd

In most cases you should prefer managed mode. Moreover, MacOS and Windows
do not support native Docker plugins. Please use managed mode on these
systems. Proceed further only if you are on Linux.

First, [install rclone](https://rclone.org/install/).
You can just run it (type `rclone serve docker` and hit enter) for the test.

Install _FUSE_:
```
sudo apt-get -y install fuse
```

Download two systemd configuration files:
[docker-volume-rclone.service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.service)
and [docker-volume-rclone.socket](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rclone/rclone/master/contrib/docker-plugin/systemd/docker-volume-rclone.socket).

Put them to the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory:
```
cp docker-volume-plugin.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp docker-volume-plugin.socket  /etc/systemd/system/
```

Please note that all commands in this section must be run as _root_ but
we omit `sudo` prefix for brevity.
Now create directories required by the service:
```
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-volumes/rclone
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/config
mkdir -p /var/lib/docker-plugins/rclone/cache
```

Run the docker plugin service in the socket activated mode:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service
systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.socket
systemctl restart docker
```

Or run the service directly:
- run `systemctl daemon-reload` to let systemd pick up new config
- run `systemctl enable docker-volume-rclone.service` to make the new
  service start automatically when you power on your machine.
- run `systemctl start docker-volume-rclone.service`
  to start the service now.
- run `systemctl restart docker` to restart docker daemon and let it
  detect the new plugin socket. Note that this step is not needed in
  managed mode where docker knows about plugin state changes.

The two methods are equivalent from the user perspective, but I personally
prefer socket activation.

## Troubleshooting

You can [see managed plugin settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/#debugging-plugins)
with
```
docker plugin list
docker plugin inspect rclone
```
Note that docker (including latest 20.10.7) will not show actual values
of `args`, just the defaults.

Use `journalctl --unit docker` to see managed plugin output as part of
the docker daemon log. Note that docker reflects plugin lines as _errors_
but their actual level can be seen from encapsulated message string.

You will usually install the latest version of managed plugin for your platform.
Use the following commands to print the actual installed version:
```
PLUGID=$(docker plugin list --no-trunc | awk '/rclone/{print$1}')
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec $PLUGID rclone version
```

You can even use `runc` to run shell inside the plugin container:
```
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec --tty $PLUGID bash
```

Also you can use curl to check the plugin socket connectivity:
```
docker plugin list --no-trunc
PLUGID=123abc...
sudo curl -H Content-Type:application/json -XPOST -d {} --unix-socket /run/docker/plugins/$PLUGID/rclone.sock http://localhost/Plugin.Activate
```
though this is rarely needed.

## Caveats

Finally I'd like to mention a _caveat with updating volume settings_.
Docker CLI does not have a dedicated command like `docker volume update`.
It may be tempting to invoke `docker volume create` with updated options
on existing volume, but there is a gotcha. The command will do nothing,
it won't even return an error. I hope that docker maintainers will fix
this some day. In the meantime be aware that you must remove your volume
before recreating it with new settings:
```
docker volume remove my_vol
docker volume create my_vol -d rclone -o opt1=new_val1 ...
```

and verify that settings did update:
```
docker volume list
docker volume inspect my_vol
```

If docker refuses to remove the volume, you should find containers
or swarm services that use it and stop them first.

#  1Fichier

This is a backend for the [1fichier](https://1fichier.com) cloud
storage service. Note that a Premium subscription is required to use
the API.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for 1Fichier involves getting the API key from the website which you
need to do in your browser.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / 1Fichier
   \ "fichier"
[snip]
Storage> fichier
** See help for fichier backend at: https://rclone.org/fichier/ **

Your API Key, get it from https://1fichier.com/console/params.pl
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
api_key> example_key

Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> 
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
type = fichier
api_key = example_key
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your 1Fichier account

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your 1Fichier account

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a 1Fichier directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes ###

1Fichier does not support modification times. It supports the Whirlpool hash algorithm.

### Duplicated files ###

1Fichier can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜           |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |
| $         | 0x24  | ＄           |
| `         | 0x60  | ｀           |
| '         | 0x27  | ＇           |

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the 1Fichier backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Alias

The `alias` remote provides a new name for another remote.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, 
e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory` or `/directory/subdirectory`.

During the initial setup with `rclone config` you will specify the target
remote. The target remote can either be a local path or another remote.

Subfolders can be used in target remote. Assume an alias remote named `backup`
with the target `mydrive:private/backup`. Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:desktop`
is exactly the same as invoking `rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop`.

There will be no special handling of paths containing `..` segments.
Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:../desktop` is exactly the same as invoking
`rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop`.
The empty path is not allowed as a remote. To alias the current directory
use `.` instead.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make an alias called `remote` for local folder.
First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Alias for an existing remote
   \ "alias"
[snip]
Storage> alias
Remote or path to alias.
Can be "myremote:path/to/dir", "myremote:bucket", "myremote:" or "/local/path".
remote> /mnt/storage/backup
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
remote = /mnt/storage/backup
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               alias

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level in `/mnt/storage/backup`

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in `/mnt/storage/backup`

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the alias directory called source

    rclone copy /home/source remote:source


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to alias (Alias for an existing remote).

#### --alias-remote

Remote or path to alias.

Can be "myremote:path/to/dir", "myremote:bucket", "myremote:" or "/local/path".

- Config:      remote
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ALIAS_REMOTE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""



#  Amazon Drive

Amazon Drive, formerly known as Amazon Cloud Drive, is a cloud storage
service run by Amazon for consumers.

## Status

**Important:** rclone supports Amazon Drive only if you have your own
set of API keys. Unfortunately the [Amazon Drive developer
program](https://developer.amazon.com/amazon-drive) is now closed to
new entries so if you don't already have your own set of keys you will
not be able to use rclone with Amazon Drive.

For the history on why rclone no longer has a set of Amazon Drive API
keys see [the forum](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-has-been-banned-from-amazon-drive/2314).

If you happen to know anyone who works at Amazon then please ask them
to re-instate rclone into the Amazon Drive developer program - thanks!

## Configuration

The initial setup for Amazon Drive involves getting a token from
Amazon which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks
you through it.

The configuration process for Amazon Drive may involve using an [oauth
proxy](https://github.com/ncw/oauthproxy). This is used to keep the
Amazon credentials out of the source code.  The proxy runs in Google's
very secure App Engine environment and doesn't store any credentials
which pass through it.

Since rclone doesn't currently have its own Amazon Drive credentials
so you will either need to have your own `client_id` and
`client_secret` with Amazon Drive, or use a third party oauth proxy
in which case you will need to enter `client_id`, `client_secret`,
`auth_url` and `token_url`.

Note also if you are not using Amazon's `auth_url` and `token_url`,
(ie you filled in something for those) then if setting up on a remote
machine you can only use the [copying the config method of
configuration](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/#configuring-by-copying-the-config-file)
- `rclone authorize` will not work.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Amazon. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification
code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require
you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Amazon Drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Amazon Drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Amazon Drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and MD5SUMs

Amazon Drive doesn't allow modification times to be changed via
the API so these won't be accurate or used for syncing.

It does store MD5SUMs so for a more accurate sync, you can use the
`--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.  Amazon
don't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Amazon's apps or via
the Amazon Drive website. As of November 17, 2016, files are 
automatically deleted by Amazon from the trash after 30 days.

### Using with non `.com` Amazon accounts

Let's say you usually use `amazon.co.uk`. When you authenticate with
rclone it will take you to an `amazon.com` page to log in.  Your
`amazon.co.uk` email and password should work here just fine.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to amazon cloud drive (Amazon Drive).

#### --acd-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --acd-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      client_secret
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_CLIENT_SECRET
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to amazon cloud drive (Amazon Drive).

#### --acd-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

- Config:      token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --acd-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --acd-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --acd-checkpoint

Checkpoint for internal polling (debug).

- Config:      checkpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_CHECKPOINT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --acd-upload-wait-per-gb

Additional time per GiB to wait after a failed complete upload to see if it appears.

Sometimes Amazon Drive gives an error when a file has been fully
uploaded but the file appears anyway after a little while.  This
happens sometimes for files over 1 GiB in size and nearly every time for
files bigger than 10 GiB. This parameter controls the time rclone waits
for the file to appear.

The default value for this parameter is 3 minutes per GiB, so by
default it will wait 3 minutes for every GiB uploaded to see if the
file appears.

You can disable this feature by setting it to 0. This may cause
conflict errors as rclone retries the failed upload but the file will
most likely appear correctly eventually.

These values were determined empirically by observing lots of uploads
of big files for a range of file sizes.

Upload with the "-v" flag to see more info about what rclone is doing
in this situation.

- Config:      upload_wait_per_gb
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_UPLOAD_WAIT_PER_GB
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     3m0s

#### --acd-templink-threshold

Files >= this size will be downloaded via their tempLink.

Files this size or more will be downloaded via their "tempLink". This
is to work around a problem with Amazon Drive which blocks downloads
of files bigger than about 10 GiB. The default for this is 9 GiB which
shouldn't need to be changed.

To download files above this threshold, rclone requests a "tempLink"
which downloads the file through a temporary URL directly from the
underlying S3 storage.

- Config:      templink_threshold
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_TEMPLINK_THRESHOLD
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     9Gi

#### --acd-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ACD_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Note that Amazon Drive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Amazon Drive has rate limiting so you may notice errors in the
sync (429 errors).  rclone will automatically retry the sync up to 3
times by default (see `--retries` flag) which should hopefully work
around this problem.

Amazon Drive has an internal limit of file sizes that can be uploaded
to the service. This limit is not officially published, but all files
larger than this will fail.

At the time of writing (Jan 2016) is in the area of 50 GiB per file.
This means that larger files are likely to fail.

Unfortunately there is no way for rclone to see that this failure is
because of file size, so it will retry the operation, as any other
failure. To avoid this problem, use `--max-size 50000M` option to limit
the maximum size of uploaded files. Note that `--max-size` does not split
files into segments, it only ignores files over this size.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Amazon Drive backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Amazon S3 Storage Providers

The S3 backend can be used with a number of different providers:


- AWS S3
- Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) Object Storage System (OSS)
- Ceph
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Dreamhost
- IBM COS S3
- Minio
- Scaleway
- SeaweedFS
- StackPath
- Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)
- Wasabi


Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Once you have made a remote (see the provider specific section above)
you can use it like this:

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

## Configuration

### Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Amz-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch, accurate to 1 ns.

If the modification time needs to be updated rclone will attempt to perform a server
side copy to update the modification if the object can be copied in a single part.
In the case the object is larger than 5Gb or is in Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
storage the object will be uploaded rather than copied.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD`
request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

### Reducing costs

#### Avoiding HEAD requests to read the modification time

By default rclone will use the modification time of objects stored in
S3 for syncing.  This is stored in object metadata which unfortunately
takes an extra HEAD request to read which can be expensive (in time
and money).

The modification time is used by default for all operations that
require checking the time a file was last updated. It allows rclone to
treat the remote more like a true filesystem, but it is inefficient on
S3 because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the metadata.

The extra API calls can be avoided when syncing (using `rclone sync`
or `rclone copy`) in a few different ways, each with its own
tradeoffs.

- `--size-only`
    - Only checks the size of files.
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - If the file doesn't change size then rclone won't detect it has
      changed.
    - `rclone sync --size-only /path/to/source s3:bucket`
- `--checksum`
    - Checks the size and MD5 checksum of files.
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - The most accurate detection of changes possible.
    - Will cause the source to read an MD5 checksum which, if it is a
      local disk, will cause lots of disk activity.
    - If the source and destination are both S3 this is the
      **recommended** flag to use for maximum efficiency.
    - `rclone sync --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket`
- `--update --use-server-modtime`
    - Uses no extra transactions.
    - Modification time becomes the time the object was uploaded.
    - For many operations this is sufficient to determine if it needs
      uploading.
    - Using `--update` along with `--use-server-modtime`, avoids the
      extra API call and uploads files whose local modification time
      is newer than the time it was last uploaded.
    - Files created with timestamps in the past will be missed by the sync.
    - `rclone sync --update --use-server-modtime /path/to/source s3:bucket`

These flags can and should be used in combination with `--fast-list` -
see below.

If using `rclone mount` or any command using the VFS (eg `rclone
serve`) commands then you might want to consider using the VFS flag
`--no-modtime` which will stop rclone reading the modification time
for every object. You could also use `--use-server-modtime` if you are
happy with the modification times of the objects being the time of
upload.

#### Avoiding GET requests to read directory listings

Rclone's default directory traversal is to process each directory
individually.  This takes one API call per directory.  Using the
`--fast-list` flag will read all info about the the objects into
memory first using a smaller number of API calls (one per 1000
objects). See the [rclone docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

    rclone sync --fast-list --checksum /path/to/source s3:bucket

`--fast-list` trades off API transactions for memory use. As a rough
guide rclone uses 1k of memory per object stored, so using
`--fast-list` on a sync of a million objects will use roughly 1 GiB of
RAM.

If you are only copying a small number of files into a big repository
then using `--no-traverse` is a good idea. This finds objects directly
instead of through directory listings. You can do a "top-up" sync very
cheaply by using `--max-age` and `--no-traverse` to copy only recent
files, eg

    rclone copy --min-age 24h --no-traverse /path/to/source s3:bucket

You'd then do a full `rclone sync` less often.

Note that `--fast-list` isn't required in the top-up sync.

#### Avoiding HEAD requests after PUT

By default rclone will HEAD every object it uploads. It does this to
check the object got uploaded correctly.

You can disable this with the [--s3-no-head](#s3-no-head) option - see
there for more details.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures.

### Hashes

For small objects which weren't uploaded as multipart uploads (objects
sized below `--s3-upload-cutoff` if uploaded with rclone) rclone uses
the `ETag:` header as an MD5 checksum.

However for objects which were uploaded as multipart uploads or with
server side encryption (SSE-AWS or SSE-C) the `ETag` header is no
longer the MD5 sum of the data, so rclone adds an additional piece of
metadata `X-Amz-Meta-Md5chksum` which is a base64 encoded MD5 hash (in
the same format as is required for `Content-MD5`).

For large objects, calculating this hash can take some time so the
addition of this hash can be disabled with `--s3-disable-checksum`.
This will mean that these objects do not have an MD5 checksum.

Note that reading this from the object takes an additional `HEAD`
request as the metadata isn't returned in object listings.

### Cleanup

If you run `rclone cleanup s3:bucket` then it will remove all pending
multipart uploads older than 24 hours. You can use the `-i` flag to
see exactly what it will do. If you want more control over the expiry
date then run `rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket -o max-age=1h` to
expire all uploads older than one hour. You can use `rclone backend
list-multipart-uploads s3:bucket` to see the pending multipart
uploads.

### Restricted filename characters

S3 allows any valid UTF-8 string as a key.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8), as
they can't be used in XML.

The following characters are replaced since these are problematic when
dealing with the REST API:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |

The encoding will also encode these file names as they don't seem to
work with the SDK properly:

| File name | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----------:|
| .         | ．          |
| ..        | ．．         |

### Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with S3 which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB.

Note that files uploaded *both* with multipart upload *and* through
crypt remotes do not have MD5 sums.

rclone switches from single part uploads to multipart uploads at the
point specified by `--s3-upload-cutoff`.  This can be a maximum of 5 GiB
and a minimum of 0 (ie always upload multipart files).

The chunk sizes used in the multipart upload are specified by
`--s3-chunk-size` and the number of chunks uploaded concurrently is
specified by `--s3-upload-concurrency`.

Multipart uploads will use `--transfers` * `--s3-upload-concurrency` *
`--s3-chunk-size` extra memory.  Single part uploads to not use extra
memory.

Single part transfers can be faster than multipart transfers or slower
depending on your latency from S3 - the more latency, the more likely
single part transfers will be faster.

Increasing `--s3-upload-concurrency` will increase throughput (8 would
be a sensible value) and increasing `--s3-chunk-size` also increases
throughput (16M would be sensible).  Increasing either of these will
use more memory.  The default values are high enough to gain most of
the possible performance without using too much memory.


### Buckets and Regions

With Amazon S3 you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any region,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the region it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong region,
you will get an error, `incorrect region, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
region`.

### Authentication

There are a number of ways to supply `rclone` with a set of AWS
credentials, with and without using the environment.

The different authentication methods are tried in this order:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (`env_auth = false` in the config file):
   - `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` are required.
   - `session_token` can be optionally set when using AWS STS.
 - Runtime configuration (`env_auth = true` in the config file):
   - Export the following environment variables before running `rclone`:
     - Access Key ID: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
     - Session Token: `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional)
   - Or, use a [named profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html):
     - Profile files are standard files used by AWS CLI tools
     - By default it will use the profile in your home directory (e.g. `~/.aws/credentials` on unix based systems) file and the "default" profile, to change set these environment variables:
         - `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to control which file.
         - `AWS_PROFILE` to control which profile to use.
   - Or, run `rclone` in an ECS task with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` on an EC2 instance with an IAM role (AWS only).
   - Or, run `rclone` in an EKS pod with an IAM role that is associated with a service account (AWS only).

If none of these option actually end up providing `rclone` with AWS
credentials then S3 interaction will be non-authenticated (see below).

### S3 Permissions

When using the `sync` subcommand of `rclone` the following minimum
permissions are required to be available on the bucket being written to:

* `ListBucket`
* `DeleteObject`
* `GetObject`
* `PutObject`
* `PutObjectACL`

When using the `lsd` subcommand, the `ListAllMyBuckets` permission is required.

Example policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::USER_SID:user/USER_NAME"
            },
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*",
              "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
        }	
    ]
}
```

Notes on above:

1. This is a policy that can be used when creating bucket. It assumes
   that `USER_NAME` has been created.
2. The Resource entry must include both resource ARNs, as one implies
   the bucket and the other implies the bucket's objects.

For reference, [here's an Ansible script](https://gist.github.com/ebridges/ebfc9042dd7c756cd101cfa807b7ae2b)
that will generate one or more buckets that will work with `rclone sync`.

### Key Management System (KMS)

If you are using server-side encryption with KMS then you must make
sure rclone is configured with `server_side_encryption = aws:kms`
otherwise you will find you can't transfer small objects - these will
create checksum errors.

### Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive

You can upload objects using the glacier storage class or transition them to glacier using a [lifecycle policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/create-lifecycle.html).
The bucket can still be synced or copied into normally, but if rclone
tries to access data from the glacier storage class you will see an error like below.

    2017/09/11 19:07:43 Failed to sync: failed to open source object: Object in GLACIER, restore first: path/to/file

In this case you need to [restore](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/restore-archived-objects.html)
the object(s) in question before using rclone.

Note that rclone only speaks the S3 API it does not speak the Glacier

#### --s3-bucket-acl

Canned ACL used when creating buckets.

For more info visit https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl

Note that this ACL is applied when only when creating buckets.  If it
isn't set then "acl" is used instead.

- Config:      bucket_acl
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_BUCKET_ACL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "private"

        - The AuthenticatedUsers group gets READ access.

#### --s3-requester-pays

Enables requester pays option when interacting with S3 bucket.

- Config:      requester_pays
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_REQUESTER_PAYS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-sse-customer-algorithm

If using SSE-C, the server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in S3.

- Config:      sse_customer_algorithm
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_ALGORITHM
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None
    - "AES256"
        - AES256

#### --s3-sse-customer-key

If using SSE-C you must provide the secret encryption key used to encrypt/decrypt your data.

- Config:      sse_customer_key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-sse-customer-key-md5

If using SSE-C you may provide the secret encryption key MD5 checksum (optional).

If you leave it blank, this is calculated automatically from the sse_customer_key provided.


- Config:      sse_customer_key_md5
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SSE_CUSTOMER_KEY_MD5
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - None

#### --s3-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size.
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200Mi

#### --s3-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff or files with unknown
size (e.g. from "rclone rcat" or uploaded with "rclone mount" or google
photos or google docs) they will be uploaded as multipart uploads
using this chunk size.

Note that "--s3-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of known size to stay below the 10,000 chunks limit.

Files of unknown size are uploaded with the configured
chunk_size. Since the default chunk size is 5 MiB and there can be at
most 10,000 chunks, this means that by default the maximum size of
a file you can stream upload is 48 GiB.  If you wish to stream upload
larger files then you will need to increase chunk_size.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi

#### --s3-max-upload-parts

Maximum number of parts in a multipart upload.

This option defines the maximum number of multipart chunks to use
when doing a multipart upload.

This can be useful if a service does not support the AWS S3
specification of 10,000 chunks.

Rclone will automatically increase the chunk size when uploading a
large file of a known size to stay below this number of chunks limit.


- Config:      max_upload_parts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MAX_UPLOAD_PARTS
- Type:        int
- Default:     10000

#### --s3-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4.656Gi

#### --s3-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-shared-credentials-file

Path to the shared credentials file.

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file.

If this variable is empty rclone will look for the
"AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE" env variable. If the env value is empty
it will default to the current user's home directory.

    Linux/OSX: "$HOME/.aws/credentials"
    Windows:   "%USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials"


- Config:      shared_credentials_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-profile

Profile to use in the shared credentials file.

If env_auth = true then rclone can use a shared credentials file. This
variable controls which profile is used in that file.

If empty it will default to the environment variable "AWS_PROFILE" or
"default" if that environment variable is also not set.


- Config:      profile
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_PROFILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-session-token

An AWS session token.

- Config:      session_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_SESSION_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --s3-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --s3-force-path-style

If true use path style access if false use virtual hosted style.

If this is true (the default) then rclone will use path style access,
if false then rclone will use virtual path style. See [the AWS S3
docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro)
for more info.

Some providers (e.g. AWS, Aliyun OSS, Netease COS, or Tencent COS) require this set to
false - rclone will do this automatically based on the provider
setting.

- Config:      force_path_style
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --s3-v2-auth

If true use v2 authentication.

If this is false (the default) then rclone will use v4 authentication.
If it is set then rclone will use v2 authentication.

Use this only if v4 signatures don't work, e.g. pre Jewel/v10 CEPH.

- Config:      v2_auth
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_V2_AUTH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-use-accelerate-endpoint

If true use the AWS S3 accelerated endpoint.

See: [AWS S3 Transfer acceleration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration-examples.html)

- Config:      use_accelerate_endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_USE_ACCELERATE_ENDPOINT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure, leaving all successfully uploaded parts on S3 for manual recovery.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

WARNING: Storing parts of an incomplete multipart upload counts towards space usage on S3 and will add additional costs if not cleaned up.


- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk (response list for each ListObject S3 request).

This option is also known as "MaxKeys", "max-items", or "page-size" from the AWS S3 specification.
Most services truncate the response list to 1000 objects even if requested more than that.
In AWS S3 this is a global maximum and cannot be changed, see [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html).
In Ceph, this can be increased with the "rgw list buckets max chunk" option.


- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --s3-no-check-bucket

If set, don't attempt to check the bucket exists or create it.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does if you know the bucket exists already.

It can also be needed if the user you are using does not have bucket
creation permissions. Before v1.52.0 this would have passed silently
due to a bug.


- Config:      no_check_bucket
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_CHECK_BUCKET
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-no-head

If set, don't HEAD uploaded objects to check integrity.

This can be useful when trying to minimise the number of transactions
rclone does.

Setting it means that if rclone receives a 200 OK message after
uploading an object with PUT then it will assume that it got uploaded
properly.

In particular it will assume:

- the metadata, including modtime, storage class and content type was as uploaded
- the size was as uploaded

It reads the following items from the response for a single part PUT:

- the MD5SUM
- The uploaded date

For multipart uploads these items aren't read.

If an source object of unknown length is uploaded then rclone **will** do a
HEAD request.

Setting this flag increases the chance for undetected upload failures,
in particular an incorrect size, so it isn't recommended for normal
operation. In practice the chance of an undetected upload failure is
very small even with this flag.


- Config:      no_head
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-no-head-object

If set, do not do HEAD before GET when getting objects.

- Config:      no_head_object
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_NO_HEAD_OBJECT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --s3-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.

Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use memory pool for allocations.
This option controls how often unused buffers will be removed from the pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --s3-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-disable-http2

Disable usage of http2 for S3 backends.

There is currently an unsolved issue with the s3 (specifically minio) backend
and HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 is enabled by default for the s3 backend but can be
disabled here.  When the issue is solved this flag will be removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4673, https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631



- Config:      disable_http2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DISABLE_HTTP2
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --s3-download-url

Custom endpoint for downloads.
This is usually set to a CloudFront CDN URL as AWS S3 offers
cheaper egress for data downloaded through the CloudFront network.

- Config:      download_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_S3_DOWNLOAD_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the s3 backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See [the "rclone backend" command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend/command).

### restore

Restore objects from GLACIER to normal storage

    rclone backend restore remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command can be used to restore one or more objects from GLACIER
to normal storage.

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/object [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket/path/to/directory [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]
    rclone backend restore s3:bucket [-o priority=PRIORITY] [-o lifetime=DAYS]

This flag also obeys the filters. Test first with -i/--interactive or --dry-run flags

    rclone -i backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard

All the objects shown will be marked for restore, then

    rclone backend restore --include "*.txt" s3:bucket/path -o priority=Standard

It returns a list of status dictionaries with Remote and Status
keys. The Status will be OK if it was successful or an error message
if not.

    [
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Path": "test.txt"
        },
        {
            "Status": "OK",
            "Path": "test/file4.txt"
        }
    ]



Options:

- "description": The optional description for the job.
- "lifetime": Lifetime of the active copy in days
- "priority": Priority of restore: Standard|Expedited|Bulk

### list-multipart-uploads

    rclone backend list-multipart-uploads remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the unfinished multipart uploads in JSON format.

    rclone backend list-multipart s3:bucket/path/to/object

It returns a dictionary of buckets with values as lists of unfinished
multipart uploads.

You can call it with no bucket in which case it lists all bucket, with
a bucket or with a bucket and path.

    {
      "rclone": [
        {
          "Initiated": "2020-06-26T14:20:36Z",
          "Initiator": {
            "DisplayName": "XXX",
            "ID": "arn:aws:iam::XXX:user/XXX"
          },
          "Key": "KEY",
          "Owner": {
            "DisplayName": null,
            "ID": "XXX"
          },
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD",
          "UploadId": "XXX"
        }
      ],
      "rclone-1000files": [],
      "rclone-dst": []
    }



### cleanup

Remove unfinished multipart uploads.

    rclone backend cleanup remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command removes unfinished multipart uploads of age greater than
max-age which defaults to 24 hours.

Note that you can use -i/--dry-run with this command to see what it
would do.

    rclone backend cleanup s3:bucket/path/to/object
    rclone backend cleanup -o max-age=7w s3:bucket/path/to/object

Durations are parsed as per the rest of rclone, 2h, 7d, 7w etc.


Options:

- "max-age": Max age of upload to delete



### Anonymous access to public buckets ###

If you want to use rclone to access a public bucket, configure with a
blank `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.  Your config should end
up looking like this:

```
[anons3]
type = s3
provider = AWS
env_auth = false
access_key_id = 
secret_access_key = 
region = us-east-1
endpoint = 
location_constraint = 
acl = private
server_side_encryption = 
storage_class = 
```

Then use it as normal with the name of the public bucket, e.g.

    rclone lsd anons3:1000genomes

You will be able to list and copy data but not upload it.

## Providers

### AWS S3

This is the provider used as main example and described in the [configuration](#configuration) section above.

### AWS Snowball Edge
[AWS Snowball](https://aws.amazon.com/snowball/) is a hardware appliance used for transferring
bulk data back to AWS. Its main software interface is S3 object storage.

To use rclone with AWS Snowball Edge devices, configure as standard for an 'S3 Compatible Service'
be sure to set `upload_cutoff = 0` otherwise you will run into authentication header issues as
the snowball device does not support query parameter based authentication.

eg.
```
[snowball]
type = s3
provider = Other
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
endpoint = http://[IP of Snowball]:8080
upload_cutoff = 0
```

### Ceph

[Ceph](https://ceph.com/) is an open source unified, distributed
storage system designed for excellent performance, reliability and
scalability.  It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.

To use rclone with Ceph, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:


```
[ceph]
type = s3
provider = Ceph
env_auth = false
access_key_id = XXX
secret_access_key = YYY
region =
endpoint = https://ceph.endpoint.example.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

If you are using an older version of CEPH, e.g. 10.2.x Jewel, then you
may need to supply the parameter `--s3-upload-cutoff 0` or put this in
the config file as `upload_cutoff 0` to work around a bug which causes
uploading of small files to fail.

Note also that Ceph sometimes puts `/` in the passwords it gives
users.  If you read the secret access key using the command line tools
you will get a JSON blob with the `/` escaped as `\/`.  Make sure you
only write `/` in the secret access key.

Eg the dump from Ceph looks something like this (irrelevant keys
removed).

```
{
    "user_id": "xxx",
    "display_name": "xxxx",
    "keys": [
        {
            "user": "xxx",
            "access_key": "xxxxxx",
            "secret_key": "xxxxxx\/xxxx"
        }
    ],
}
```

Because this is a json dump, it is encoding the `/` as `\/`, so if you
use the secret key as `xxxxxx/xxxx`  it will work fine.

### Dreamhost

Dreamhost [DreamObjects](https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/) is
an object storage system based on CEPH.

To use rclone with Dreamhost, configure as above but leave the region blank
and set the endpoint.  You should end up with something like this in
your config:

```
[dreamobjects]
type = s3
provider = DreamHost
env_auth = false
access_key_id = your_access_key
secret_access_key = your_secret_key
region =
endpoint = objects-us-west-1.dream.io
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

### DigitalOcean Spaces

[Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/object-storage/) is an [S3-interoperable](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/spaces/) object storage service from cloud provider DigitalOcean.

To connect to DigitalOcean Spaces you will need an access key and secret key. These can be retrieved on the "[Applications & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/api/tokens)" page of the DigitalOcean control panel. They will be needed when prompted by `rclone config` for your `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`.

When prompted for a `region` or `location_constraint`, press enter to use the default value. The region must be included in the `endpoint` setting (e.g. `nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com`). The default values can be used for other settings.

Going through the whole process of creating a new remote by running `rclone config`, each prompt should be answered as shown below:

```
Storage> s3
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key> YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region>
endpoint> nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint>
acl>
storage_class>
```

The resulting configuration file should look like:

```
[spaces]
type = s3
provider = DigitalOcean
env_auth = false
access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
region =
endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
location_constraint =
acl =
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

Once configured, you can create a new Space and begin copying files. For example:

```
rclone mkdir spaces:my-new-space
rclone copy /path/to/files spaces:my-new-space
```

### IBM COS (S3)

      \ "authenticated-read"
acl> 1
```


12. Review the displayed configuration and accept to save the "remote" then quit. The config file should look like this
```
	[xxx]
	type = s3
	Provider = IBMCOS
	access_key_id = xxx
	secret_access_key = yyy
	endpoint = s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net
	location_constraint = us-standard
	acl = private
```

13. Execute rclone commands
```
	1)	Create a bucket.
		rclone mkdir IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket
	2)	List available buckets.
		rclone lsd IBM-COS-XREGION:
		-1 2017-11-08 21:16:22        -1 test
		-1 2018-02-14 20:16:39        -1 newbucket

		rclone copy IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt .
	6)	Delete a file on remote.
		rclone delete IBM-COS-XREGION:newbucket/file.txt
```

### Minio

[Minio](https://minio.io/) is an object storage server built for cloud application developers and devops.

It is very easy to install and provides an S3 compatible server which can be used by rclone.

To use it, install Minio following the instructions [here](https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide).

When it configures itself Minio will print something like this

```
Endpoint:  http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000
AccessKey: USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
SecretKey: MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
Region:    us-east-1
SQS ARNs:  arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:1:redis arn:minio:sqs:us-east-1:2:redis

Browser Access:
   http://192.168.1.106:9000  http://172.23.0.1:9000

Command-line Access: https://docs.minio.io/docs/minio-client-quickstart-guide
   $ mc config host add myminio http://192.168.1.106:9000 USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03

Object API (Amazon S3 compatible):
   Go:         https://docs.minio.io/docs/golang-client-quickstart-guide
   Java:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide
   Python:     https://docs.minio.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide
   JavaScript: https://docs.minio.io/docs/javascript-client-quickstart-guide
   .NET:       https://docs.minio.io/docs/dotnet-client-quickstart-guide

Drive Capacity: 26 GiB Free, 165 GiB Total
```

These details need to go into `rclone config` like this.  Note that it
is important to put the region in as stated above.

```
env_auth> 1
access_key_id> USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key> MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region> us-east-1
endpoint> http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint>
server_side_encryption>
```

Which makes the config file look like this

```
[minio]
type = s3
provider = Minio
env_auth = false
access_key_id = USWUXHGYZQYFYFFIT3RE
secret_access_key = MOJRH0mkL1IPauahWITSVvyDrQbEEIwljvmxdq03
region = us-east-1
endpoint = http://192.168.1.106:9000
location_constraint =
server_side_encryption =
```

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

```
rclone copy /path/to/files minio:bucket
```

### Scaleway

[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/object-storage/) The Object Storage platform allows you to store anything from backups, logs and web assets to documents and photos.
Files can be dropped from the Scaleway console or transferred through our API and CLI or using any S3-compatible tool.

Scaleway provides an S3 interface which can be configured for use with rclone like this:

```
[scaleway]
type = s3
provider = Scaleway
env_auth = false
endpoint = s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud
access_key_id = SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
secret_access_key = 1111111-2222-3333-44444-55555555555555
region = nl-ams
location_constraint =
acl = private
server_side_encryption =
storage_class =
```

### SeaweedFS

[SeaweedFS](https://github.com/chrislusf/seaweedfs/) is a distributed storage system for 
blobs, objects, files, and data lake, with O(1) disk seek and a scalable file metadata store.
It has an S3 compatible object storage interface.

Assuming the SeaweedFS are configured with `weed shell` as such:
```
> s3.bucket.create -name foo
> s3.configure -access_key=any -secret_key=any -buckets=foo -user=me -actions=Read,Write,List,Tagging,Admin -apply
{
  "identities": [
    {
      "name": "me",
      "credentials": [
        {
          "accessKey": "any",
          "secretKey": "any"
        }
      ],
      "actions": [
        "Read:foo",
        "Write:foo",
        "List:foo",
        "Tagging:foo",
        "Admin:foo"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

To use rclone with SeaweedFS, above configuration should end up with something like this in
your config:

```
[seaweedfs_s3]
type = s3
provider = SeaweedFS
access_key_id = any
secret_access_key = any
endpoint = localhost:8333
```

So once set up, for example to copy files into a bucket

```
rclone copy /path/to/files seaweedfs_s3:foo
```

### Wasabi

[Wasabi](https://wasabi.com) is a cloud-based object storage service for a
broad range of applications and use cases. Wasabi is designed for
individuals and organizations that require a high-performance,
reliable, and secure data storage infrastructure at minimal cost.

Wasabi provides an S3 interface which can be configured for use with
rclone like this.

### Netease NOS

For Netease NOS configure as per the configurator `rclone config`
setting the provider `Netease`.  This will automatically set
`force_path_style = false` which is necessary for it to run properly.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the S3 backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Backblaze B2

B2 is [Backblaze's cloud storage system](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/).

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a b2 configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.  To authenticate
you will either need your Account ID (a short hex number) and Master
Application Key (a long hex number) OR an Application Key, which is the
recommended method. See below for further details on generating and using
an Application Key.

```
No remotes found - make a new one

endpoint =
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Create a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any
excess files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Application Keys

B2 supports multiple [Application Keys for different access permission
to B2 Buckets](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/application_keys.html).

You can use these with rclone too; you will need to use rclone version 1.43
or later.

Follow Backblaze's docs to create an Application Key with the required
permission and add the `applicationKeyId` as the `account` and the
`Application Key` itself as the `key`.

Note that you must put the _applicationKeyId_ as the `account` – you
can't use the master Account ID.  If you try then B2 will return 401
errors.

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Bz-Info-src_last_modified_millis` as milliseconds since 1970-01-01
in the Backblaze standard.  Other tools should be able to use this as
a modified time.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported. Note that
if a modification time needs to be updated on an object then it will
create a new version of the object.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

Note that in 2020-05 Backblaze started allowing \ characters in file
names. Rclone hasn't changed its encoding as this could cause syncs to
re-transfer files. If you want rclone not to replace \ then see the
`--b2-encoding` flag below and remove the `BackSlash` from the
string. This can be set in the config.

### SHA1 checksums

The SHA1 checksums of the files are checked on upload and download and
will be used in the syncing process.

Large files (bigger than the limit in `--b2-upload-cutoff`) which are
uploaded in chunks will store their SHA1 on the object as
`X-Bz-Info-large_file_sha1` as recommended by Backblaze.

For a large file to be uploaded with an SHA1 checksum, the source
needs to support SHA1 checksums. The local disk supports SHA1
checksums so large file transfers from local disk will have an SHA1.
See [the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#features) for exactly which remotes
support SHA1.

Sources which don't support SHA1, in particular `crypt` will upload
large files without SHA1 checksums.  This may be fixed in the future
(see [#1767](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1767)).

Files sizes below `--b2-upload-cutoff` will always have an SHA1
regardless of the source.

### Transfers

Backblaze recommends that you do lots of transfers simultaneously for
maximum speed.  In tests from my SSD equipped laptop the optimum
setting is about `--transfers 32` though higher numbers may be used
for a slight speed improvement. The optimum number for you may vary
depending on your hardware, how big the files are, how much you want
to load your computer, etc.  The default of `--transfers 4` is
definitely too low for Backblaze B2 though.

Note that uploading big files (bigger than 200 MiB by default) will use
a 96 MiB RAM buffer by default.  There can be at most `--transfers` of
these in use at any moment, so this sets the upper limit on the memory
used.

### Versions

When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a [new version
of it](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/file_versions.html).
Likewise when you delete a file, the old version will be marked hidden
and still be available.  Conversely, you may opt in to a "hard delete"
of files with the `--b2-hard-delete` flag which would permanently remove
the file instead of hiding it.

Old versions of files, where available, are visible using the 
`--b2-versions` flag.

If you wish to remove all the old versions then you can use the
`rclone cleanup remote:bucket` command which will delete all the old
versions of files, leaving the current ones intact.  You can also
supply a path and only old versions under that path will be deleted,
e.g. `rclone cleanup remote:bucket/path/to/stuff`.

Note that `cleanup` will remove partially uploaded files from the bucket
if they are more than a day old.

When you `purge` a bucket, the current and the old versions will be
deleted then the bucket will be deleted.

However `delete` will cause the current versions of the files to
become hidden old versions.

Here is a session showing the listing and retrieval of an old
version followed by a `cleanup` of the old versions.

Show current version and all the versions with `--b2-versions` flag.

```
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
```

Retrieve an old version

```
$ rclone -q --b2-versions copy b2:cleanup-test/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt /tmp

$ ls -l /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ncw ncw 16 Jul  2 17:46 /tmp/one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
```

Clean up all the old versions and show that they've gone.

```
$ rclone -q cleanup b2:cleanup-test

$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt

$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

### Data usage

It is useful to know how many requests are sent to the server in different scenarios.

All copy commands send the following 4 requests:

```
/b2api/v1/b2_authorize_account
/b2api/v1/b2_create_bucket
/b2api/v1/b2_list_buckets
/b2api/v1/b2_list_file_names
```

The `b2_list_file_names` request will be sent once for every 1k files
in the remote path, providing the checksum and modification time of
the listed files. As of version 1.33 issue
[#818](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/818) causes extra requests
to be sent when using B2 with Crypt. When a copy operation does not
require any files to be uploaded, no more requests will be sent.

Uploading files that do not require chunking, will send 2 requests per
file upload:

```
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_file/
```

Uploading files requiring chunking, will send 2 requests (one each to
start and finish the upload) and another 2 requests for each chunk:

```
/b2api/v1/b2_start_large_file
/b2api/v1/b2_get_upload_part_url
/b2api/v1/b2_upload_part/
/b2api/v1/b2_finish_large_file
```

#### Versions

Versions can be viewed with the `--b2-versions` flag. When it is set
rclone will show and act on older versions of files.  For example

Listing without `--b2-versions`

```
$ rclone -q ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
```

And with

```
$ rclone -q --b2-versions ls b2:cleanup-test
        9 one.txt
        8 one-v2016-07-04-141032-000.txt
       16 one-v2016-07-04-141003-000.txt
       15 one-v2016-07-02-155621-000.txt
```

Showing that the current version is unchanged but older versions can
be seen.  These have the UTC date that they were uploaded to the
server to the nearest millisecond appended to them.

Note that when using `--b2-versions` no file write operations are
permitted, so you can't upload files or delete them.

### B2 and rclone link

Rclone supports generating file share links for private B2 buckets.
They can either be for a file for example:

```
./rclone link B2:bucket/path/to/file.txt
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file.txt?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

```

or if run on a directory you will get:

```
./rclone link B2:bucket/path
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
```

you can then use the authorization token (the part of the url from the
 `?Authorization=` on) on any file path under that directory. For example:

```
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/to/file1?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/file2?Authorization=xxxxxxxx
https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/bucket/path/folder/file3?Authorization=xxxxxxxx

```


### Standard options

- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --b2-key

Application Key.

- Config:      key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_KEY
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --b2-hard-delete

Permanently delete files on remote removal, otherwise hide files.

- Config:      hard_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_HARD_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to b2 (Backblaze B2).

#### --b2-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --b2-test-mode

A flag string for X-Bz-Test-Mode header for debugging.

This is for debugging purposes only. Setting it to one of the strings
below will cause b2 to return specific errors:

  * "fail_some_uploads"
  * "expire_some_account_authorization_tokens"
  * "force_cap_exceeded"

These will be set in the "X-Bz-Test-Mode" header which is documented
in the [b2 integrations checklist](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/integration_checklist.html).

- Config:      test_mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_TEST_MODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --b2-versions

Include old versions in directory listings.

Note that when using this no file write operations are permitted,
so you can't upload files or delete them.

- Config:      versions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_VERSIONS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --b2-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Files above this size will be uploaded in chunks of "--b2-chunk-size".

This value should be set no larger than 4.657 GiB (== 5 GB).

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200Mi

#### --b2-copy-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to multipart copy.

Any files larger than this that need to be server-side copied will be
copied in chunks of this size.

The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 4.6 GiB.

- Config:      copy_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_COPY_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4Gi

#### --b2-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

When uploading large files, chunk the file into this size.

Must fit in memory. These chunks are buffered in memory and there
might a maximum of "--transfers" chunks in progress at once.

5,000,000 Bytes is the minimum size.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     96Mi

#### --b2-disable-checksum

Disable checksums for large (> upload cutoff) files.

Normally rclone will calculate the SHA1 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --b2-download-url

Custom endpoint for downloads.

This is usually set to a Cloudflare CDN URL as Backblaze offers
free egress for data downloaded through the Cloudflare network.
Rclone works with private buckets by sending an "Authorization" header.
If the custom endpoint rewrites the requests for authentication,
e.g., in Cloudflare Workers, this header needs to be handled properly.
Leave blank if you want to use the endpoint provided by Backblaze.

- Config:      download_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --b2-download-auth-duration

Time before the authorization token will expire in s or suffix ms|s|m|h|d.

The duration before the download authorization token will expire.
The minimum value is 1 second. The maximum value is one week.

- Config:      download_auth_duration
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_DOWNLOAD_AUTH_DURATION
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1w

#### --b2-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.
Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use memory pool for allocations.
This option controls how often unused buffers will be removed from the pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --b2-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --b2-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_B2_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the B2 backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Box

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

The initial setup for Box involves getting a token from Box which you
can do either in your browser, or with a config.json downloaded from Box
to use JWT authentication.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"XXX"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Box. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Box

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Box

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Box directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Using rclone with an Enterprise account with SSO

If you have an "Enterprise" account type with Box with single sign on
(SSO), you need to create a password to use Box with rclone. This can
be done at your Enterprise Box account by going to Settings, "Account"
Tab, and then set the password in the "Authentication" field.

Once you have done this, you can setup your Enterprise Box account
using the same procedure detailed above in the, using the password you
have just set.

### Invalid refresh token

According to the [box docs](https://developer.box.com/v2.0/docs/oauth-20#section-6-using-the-access-and-refresh-tokens):

> Each refresh_token is valid for one use in 60 days.

This means that if you

  * Don't use the box remote for 60 days
  * Copy the config file with a box refresh token in and use it in two places
  * Get an error on a token refresh

then rclone will return an error which includes the text `Invalid
refresh token`.

To fix this you will need to use oauth2 again to update the refresh
token.  You can use the methods in [the remote setup
docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/), bearing in mind that if you use the copy the
config file method, you should not use that remote on the computer you
did the authentication on.

Here is how to do it.

```
$ rclone config
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====

### Modified time and hashes

Box allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Box supports SHA1 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Transfers

For files above 50 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer.  Rclone will
upload up to `--transfers` chunks at the same time (shared among all
the multipart uploads).  Chunks are buffered in memory and are
normally 8 MiB so increasing `--transfers` will increase memory use.

### Deleting files

Depending on the enterprise settings for your user, the item will
either be actually deleted from Box or moved to the trash.

Emptying the trash is supported via the rclone however cleanup command
however this deletes every trashed file and folder individually so it
may take a very long time. 
Emptying the trash via the  WebUI does not have this limitation 
so it is advised to empty the trash via the WebUI.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your Box drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the last segment
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the Box web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://app.box.com/folder/11xxxxxxxxx8`
in the browser, then you use `11xxxxxxxxx8` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.

## Limitations

Note that Box is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

Box file names can't have the `\` character in.  rclone maps this to
and from an identical looking unicode equivalent `＼` (U+FF3C Fullwidth
Reverse Solidus).

Box only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Box backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Cache (DEPRECATED)

The `cache` remote wraps another existing remote and stores file structure
and its data for long running tasks like `rclone mount`.

## Status

The cache backend code is working but it currently doesn't
have a maintainer so there are [outstanding bugs](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22Remote%3A+Cache%22) which aren't getting fixed.

The cache backend is due to be phased out in favour of the VFS caching
layer eventually which is more tightly integrated into rclone.

Until this happens we recommend only using the cache backend if you
find you can't work without it. There are many docs online describing
the use of the cache backend to minimize API hits and by-and-large
these are out of date and the cache backend isn't needed in those
scenarios any more.

## Configuration

To get started you just need to have an existing remote which can be configured
with `cache`.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `test-cache`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> test-cache
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Cache a remote
   \ "cache"
[snip]
Storage> cache
Remote to cache.
Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).
remote> local:/test
Optional: The URL of the Plex server
plex_url> http://127.0.0.1:32400
Optional: The username of the Plex user

Optional: The password of the Plex user
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank

   \ "1M"
 2 / 5 MiB
   \ "5M"
 3 / 10 MiB
   \ "10M"
chunk_size> 2
How much time should object info (file size, file hashes, etc.) be stored in cache. Use a very high value if you don't plan on changing the source FS from outside the cache.
Accepted units are: "s", "m", "h".
Default: 5m
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 1 hour
   \ "1h"
 2 / 24 hours
   \ "24h"
 3 / 24 hours
   \ "48h"
info_age> 2
The maximum size of stored chunks. When the storage grows beyond this size, the oldest chunks will be deleted.
Default: 10G
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / 500 MiB
   \ "500M"
 2 / 1 GiB
   \ "1G"
 3 / 10 GiB
   \ "10G"
chunk_total_size> 3
Remote config
--------------------
[test-cache]
remote = local:/test
plex_url = http://127.0.0.1:32400
plex_username = dummyusername
plex_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
chunk_size = 5M
info_age = 48h
chunk_total_size = 10G
```

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd test-cache:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls test-cache:

To start a cached mount

    rclone mount --allow-other test-cache: /var/tmp/test-cache

### Write Features ###

### Offline uploading ###

In an effort to make writing through cache more reliable, the backend 
now supports this feature which can be activated by specifying a
`cache-tmp-upload-path`.

A files goes through these states when using this feature:

1. An upload is started (usually by copying a file on the cache remote)
2. When the copy to the temporary location is complete the file is part 
of the cached remote and looks and behaves like any other file (reading included)
3. After `cache-tmp-wait-time` passes and the file is next in line, `rclone move` 
is used to move the file to the cloud provider
4. Reading the file still works during the upload but most modifications on it will be prohibited
5. Once the move is complete the file is unlocked for modifications as it
becomes as any other regular file
6. If the file is being read through `cache` when it's actually
deleted from the temporary path then `cache` will simply swap the source
to the cloud provider without interrupting the reading (small blip can happen though)

Files are uploaded in sequence and only one file is uploaded at a time.
Uploads will be stored in a queue and be processed based on the order they were added.
The queue and the temporary storage is persistent across restarts but
can be cleared on startup with the `--cache-db-purge` flag.

### Write Support ###

Writes are supported through `cache`.
One caveat is that a mounted cache remote does not add any retry or fallback
mechanism to the upload operation. This will depend on the implementation
of the wrapped remote. Consider using `Offline uploading` for reliable writes.

One special case is covered with `cache-writes` which will cache the file
data at the same time as the upload when it is enabled making it available
from the cache store immediately once the upload is finished.

### Read Features ###

#### Multiple connections ####

To counter the high latency between a local PC where rclone is running
and cloud providers, the cache remote can split multiple requests to the
cloud provider for smaller file chunks and combines them together locally
where they can be available almost immediately before the reader usually
needs them.

This is similar to buffering when media files are played online. Rclone
will stay around the current marker but always try its best to stay ahead
and prepare the data before.

#### Plex Integration ####

There is a direct integration with Plex which allows cache to detect during reading
if the file is in playback or not. This helps cache to adapt how it queries
the cloud provider depending on what is needed for.

Scans will have a minimum amount of workers (1) while in a confirmed playback cache
will deploy the configured number of workers.

This integration opens the doorway to additional performance improvements
which will be explored in the near future.

**Note:** If Plex options are not configured, `cache` will function with its
configured options without adapting any of its settings.

How to enable? Run `rclone config` and add all the Plex options (endpoint, username
and password) in your remote and it will be automatically enabled.

Affected settings:
- `cache-workers`: _Configured value_ during confirmed playback or _1_ all the other times

##### Certificate Validation #####

When the Plex server is configured to only accept secure connections, it is
possible to use `.plex.direct` URLs to ensure certificate validation succeeds.
These URLs are used by Plex internally to connect to the Plex server securely.

The format for these URLs is the following:

`https://ip-with-dots-replaced.server-hash.plex.direct:32400/`

The `ip-with-dots-replaced` part can be any IPv4 address, where the dots
have been replaced with dashes, e.g. `127.0.0.1` becomes `127-0-0-1`.

To get the `server-hash` part, the easiest way is to visit

https://plex.tv/api/resources?includeHttps=1&X-Plex-Token=your-plex-token

This page will list all the available Plex servers for your account
with at least one `.plex.direct` link for each. Copy one URL and replace
the IP address with the desired address. This can be used as the
`plex_url` value.

### Known issues ###

#### Mount and --dir-cache-time ####

--dir-cache-time controls the first layer of directory caching which works at the mount layer.
Being an independent caching mechanism from the `cache` backend, it will manage its own entries
based on the configured time.

To avoid getting in a scenario where dir cache has obsolete data and cache would have the correct
one, try to set `--dir-cache-time` to a lower time than `--cache-info-age`. Default values are
already configured in this way. 

#### Windows support - Experimental ####

There are a couple of issues with Windows `mount` functionality that still require some investigations.
It should be considered as experimental thus far as fixes come in for this OS.

Most of the issues seem to be related to the difference between filesystems
on Linux flavors and Windows as cache is heavily dependent on them.

Any reports or feedback on how cache behaves on this OS is greatly appreciated.

- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1907
- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1834 

#### Risk of throttling ####

Future iterations of the cache backend will make use of the pooling functionality
of the cloud provider to synchronize and at the same time make writing through it
more tolerant to failures. 

There are a couple of enhancements in track to add these but in the meantime
there is a valid concern that the expiring cache listings can lead to cloud provider
throttles or bans due to repeated queries on it for very large mounts.

Some recommendations:
- don't use a very small interval for entry information (`--cache-info-age`)
- while writes aren't yet optimised, you can still write through `cache` which gives you the advantage
of adding the file in the cache at the same time if configured to do so.

Future enhancements:

- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1937
- https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1936 

#### cache and crypt ####

One common scenario is to keep your data encrypted in the cloud provider
using the `crypt` remote. `crypt` uses a similar technique to wrap around
an existing remote and handles this translation in a seamless way.

There is an issue with wrapping the remotes in this order:
**cloud remote** -> **crypt** -> **cache**

During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this order.
I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud provider
which makes it think we're downloading the full file instead of small chunks.
Organizing the remotes in this order yields better results:
**cloud remote** -> **cache** -> **crypt**

#### absolute remote paths ####

`cache` can not differentiate between relative and absolute paths for the wrapped remote.
Any path given in the `remote` config setting and on the command line will be passed to
the wrapped remote as is, but for storing the chunks on disk the path will be made
relative by removing any leading `/` character.

This behavior is irrelevant for most backend types, but there are backends where a leading `/`
changes the effective directory, e.g. in the `sftp` backend paths starting with a `/` are
relative to the root of the SSH server and paths without are relative to the user home directory.
As a result `sftp:bin` and `sftp:/bin` will share the same cache folder, even if they represent
a different directory on the SSH server.

### Cache and Remote Control (--rc) ###
Cache supports the new `--rc` mode in rclone and can be remote controlled through the following end points:
By default, the listener is disabled if you do not add the flag.

### rc cache/expire
Purge a remote from the cache backend. Supports either a directory or a file.
It supports both encrypted and unencrypted file names if cache is wrapped by crypt.

Params:
  - **remote** = path to remote **(required)**
  - **withData** = true/false to delete cached data (chunks) as well _(optional, false by default)_


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to cache (Cache a remote).

#### --cache-remote

Remote to cache.

Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).

- Config:      remote
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_REMOTE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-plex-url

The URL of the Plex server.

- Config:      plex_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-plex-username

The username of the Plex user.

- Config:      plex_username
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_USERNAME
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-plex-password

The password of the Plex user.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      plex_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-chunk-size

The size of a chunk (partial file data).

Use lower numbers for slower connections. If the chunk size is
changed, any downloaded chunks will be invalid and cache-chunk-path
will need to be cleared or unexpected EOF errors will occur.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Mi
- Examples:
    - "1M"
        - 1 MiB
    - "5M"
        - 5 MiB
    - "10M"
        - 10 MiB

#### --cache-info-age

How long to cache file structure information (directory listings, file size, times, etc.). 
If all write operations are done through the cache then you can safely make
this value very large as the cache store will also be updated in real time.

- Config:      info_age
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_INFO_AGE
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     6h0m0s
- Examples:
    - "1h"
        - 1 hour
    - "24h"
        - 24 hours
    - "48h"
        - 48 hours

#### --cache-chunk-total-size

The total size that the chunks can take up on the local disk.

If the cache exceeds this value then it will start to delete the
oldest chunks until it goes under this value.

- Config:      chunk_total_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_TOTAL_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Gi
- Examples:
    - "500M"
        - 500 MiB
    - "1G"
        - 1 GiB
    - "10G"
        - 10 GiB

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to cache (Cache a remote).

#### --cache-plex-token

The plex token for authentication - auto set normally.

- Config:      plex_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-plex-insecure

Skip all certificate verification when connecting to the Plex server.

- Config:      plex_insecure
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_PLEX_INSECURE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-db-path

Directory to store file structure metadata DB.

The remote name is used as the DB file name.

- Config:      db_path
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PATH
- Type:        string
- Default:     "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"

#### --cache-chunk-path

Directory to cache chunk files.

Path to where partial file data (chunks) are stored locally. The remote
name is appended to the final path.

This config follows the "--cache-db-path". If you specify a custom
location for "--cache-db-path" and don't specify one for "--cache-chunk-path"
then "--cache-chunk-path" will use the same path as "--cache-db-path".

- Config:      chunk_path
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_PATH
- Type:        string
- Default:     "$HOME/.cache/rclone/cache-backend"

#### --cache-db-purge

Clear all the cached data for this remote on start.

- Config:      db_purge
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DB_PURGE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --cache-chunk-clean-interval

How often should the cache perform cleanups of the chunk storage.

The default value should be ok for most people. If you find that the
cache goes over "cache-chunk-total-size" too often then try to lower
this value to force it to perform cleanups more often.

- Config:      chunk_clean_interval
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_CLEAN_INTERVAL
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --cache-read-retries

How many times to retry a read from a cache storage.

Since reading from a cache stream is independent from downloading file
data, readers can get to a point where there's no more data in the
cache.  Most of the times this can indicate a connectivity issue if
cache isn't able to provide file data anymore.

For really slow connections, increase this to a point where the stream is
able to provide data but your experience will be very stuttering.

- Config:      read_retries
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_READ_RETRIES
- Type:        int
- Default:     10

#### --cache-workers

How many workers should run in parallel to download chunks.

Higher values will mean more parallel processing (better CPU needed)
and more concurrent requests on the cloud provider.  This impacts
several aspects like the cloud provider API limits, more stress on the
hardware that rclone runs on but it also means that streams will be
more fluid and data will be available much more faster to readers.

**Note**: If the optional Plex integration is enabled then this
setting will adapt to the type of reading performed and the value
specified here will be used as a maximum number of workers to use.

- Config:      workers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_WORKERS
- Type:        int
- Default:     4

#### --cache-chunk-no-memory

Disable the in-memory cache for storing chunks during streaming.

By default, cache will keep file data during streaming in RAM as well
to provide it to readers as fast as possible.

This transient data is evicted as soon as it is read and the number of
chunks stored doesn't exceed the number of workers. However, depending
on other settings like "cache-chunk-size" and "cache-workers" this footprint
can increase if there are parallel streams too (multiple files being read
at the same time).

If the hardware permits it, use this feature to provide an overall better
performance during streaming but it can also be disabled if RAM is not
available on the local machine.

- Config:      chunk_no_memory
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_CHUNK_NO_MEMORY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --cache-rps

Limits the number of requests per second to the source FS (-1 to disable).

This setting places a hard limit on the number of requests per second
that cache will be doing to the cloud provider remote and try to
respect that value by setting waits between reads.

If you find that you're getting banned or limited on the cloud
provider through cache and know that a smaller number of requests per
second will allow you to work with it then you can use this setting
for that.

A good balance of all the other settings should make this setting
useless but it is available to set for more special cases.

**NOTE**: This will limit the number of requests during streams but
other API calls to the cloud provider like directory listings will
still pass.

- Config:      rps
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_RPS
- Type:        int
- Default:     -1

#### --cache-writes

Cache file data on writes through the FS.

If you need to read files immediately after you upload them through
cache you can enable this flag to have their data stored in the
cache store at the same time during upload.

- Config:      writes
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_WRITES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --cache-tmp-upload-path

Directory to keep temporary files until they are uploaded.

This is the path where cache will use as a temporary storage for new
files that need to be uploaded to the cloud provider.

Specifying a value will enable this feature. Without it, it is
completely disabled and files will be uploaded directly to the cloud
provider

- Config:      tmp_upload_path
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_UPLOAD_PATH
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --cache-tmp-wait-time

How long should files be stored in local cache before being uploaded.

This is the duration that a file must wait in the temporary location
_cache-tmp-upload-path_ before it is selected for upload.

Note that only one file is uploaded at a time and it can take longer
to start the upload if a queue formed for this purpose.

- Config:      tmp_wait_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_TMP_WAIT_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     15s

#### --cache-db-wait-time

How long to wait for the DB to be available - 0 is unlimited.

Only one process can have the DB open at any one time, so rclone waits
for this duration for the DB to become available before it gives an
error.

If you set it to 0 then it will wait forever.

- Config:      db_wait_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CACHE_DB_WAIT_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1s

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the cache backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See [the "rclone backend" command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend/command).

# Chunker (BETA)

The `chunker` overlay transparently splits large files into smaller chunks
during upload to wrapped remote and transparently assembles them back
when the file is downloaded. This allows to effectively overcome size limits
imposed by storage providers.

## Configuration

To use it, first set up the underlying remote following the configuration
instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead of
a remote.

First check your chosen remote is working - we'll call it `remote:path` here.
Note that anything inside `remote:path` will be chunked and anything outside
won't. This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (e.g. S3, B2, swift)
then you should probably put the bucket in the remote `s3:bucket`.

Now configure `chunker` using `rclone config`. We will call this one `overlay`
to separate it from the `remote` itself.

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> overlay
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Transparently chunk/split large files
   \ "chunker"
[snip]
Storage> chunker
Remote to chunk/unchunk.
Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
remote> remote:path
Files larger than chunk size will be split in chunks.
Enter a size with suffix K,M,G,T. Press Enter for the default ("2G").
chunk_size> 100M
Choose how chunker handles hash sums. All modes but "none" require metadata.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("md5").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Pass any hash supported by wrapped remote for non-chunked files, return nothing otherwise
   \ "none"
 2 / MD5 for composite files
   \ "md5"
 3 / SHA1 for composite files
   \ "sha1"
 4 / MD5 for all files
   \ "md5all"
 5 / SHA1 for all files
   \ "sha1all"
 6 / Copying a file to chunker will request MD5 from the source falling back to SHA1 if unsupported
   \ "md5quick"
 7 / Similar to "md5quick" but prefers SHA1 over MD5
   \ "sha1quick"

d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Specifying the remote

In normal use, make sure the remote has a `:` in. If you specify the remote
without a `:` then rclone will use a local directory of that name.
So if you use a remote of `/path/to/secret/files` then rclone will
chunk stuff in that directory. If you use a remote of `name` then rclone
will put files in a directory called `name` in the current directory.


### Chunking

When rclone starts a file upload, chunker checks the file size. If it
doesn't exceed the configured chunk size, chunker will just pass the file
to the wrapped remote. If a file is large, chunker will transparently cut
data in pieces with temporary names and stream them one by one, on the fly.
Each data chunk will contain the specified number of bytes, except for the
last one which may have less data. If file size is unknown in advance
(this is called a streaming upload), chunker will internally create
a temporary copy, record its size and repeat the above process.

When upload completes, temporary chunk files are finally renamed.
This scheme guarantees that operations can be run in parallel and look
from outside as atomic.
A similar method with hidden temporary chunks is used for other operations
(copy/move/rename, etc.). If an operation fails, hidden chunks are normally
destroyed, and the target composite file stays intact.

When a composite file download is requested, chunker transparently
assembles it by concatenating data chunks in order. As the split is trivial
one could even manually concatenate data chunks together to obtain the
original content.

When the `list` rclone command scans a directory on wrapped remote,
the potential chunk files are accounted for, grouped and assembled into
composite directory entries. Any temporary chunks are hidden.

List and other commands can sometimes come across composite files with
missing or invalid chunks, e.g. shadowed by like-named directory or
another file. This usually means that wrapped file system has been directly
tampered with or damaged. If chunker detects a missing chunk it will
by default print warning, skip the whole incomplete group of chunks but
proceed with current command.
You can set the `--chunker-fail-hard` flag to have commands abort with
error message in such cases.


#### Chunk names

The default chunk name format is `*.rclone_chunk.###`, hence by default
chunk names are `BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001`,
`BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.002` etc. You can configure another name format
using the `name_format` configuration file option. The format uses asterisk
`*` as a placeholder for the base file name and one or more consecutive
hash characters `#` as a placeholder for sequential chunk number.
There must be one and only one asterisk. The number of consecutive hash
characters defines the minimum length of a string representing a chunk number.
If decimal chunk number has less digits than the number of hashes, it is
left-padded by zeros. If the decimal string is longer, it is left intact.
By default numbering starts from 1 but there is another option that allows
user to start from 0, e.g. for compatibility with legacy software.

For example, if name format is `big_*-##.part` and original file name is
`data.txt` and numbering starts from 0, then the first chunk will be named
`big_data.txt-00.part`, the 99th chunk will be `big_data.txt-98.part`
and the 302nd chunk will become `big_data.txt-301.part`.

Note that `list` assembles composite directory entries only when chunk names
match the configured format and treats non-conforming file names as normal
non-chunked files.

When using `norename` transactions, chunk names will additionally have a unique
file version suffix. For example, `BIG_FILE_NAME.rclone_chunk.001_bp562k`.


### Metadata

Besides data chunks chunker will by default create metadata object for
a composite file. The object is named after the original file.
Chunker allows user to disable metadata completely (the `none` format).
Note that metadata is normally not created for files smaller than the
configured chunk size. This may change in future rclone releases.

#### Simple JSON metadata format

This is the default format. It supports hash sums and chunk validation
for composite files. Meta objects carry the following fields:

- `ver`     - version of format, currently `1`
- `size`    - total size of composite file
- `nchunks` - number of data chunks in file
- `md5`     - MD5 hashsum of composite file (if present)
- `sha1`    - SHA1 hashsum (if present)
- `txn`     - identifies current version of the file

There is no field for composite file name as it's simply equal to the name
of meta object on the wrapped remote. Please refer to respective sections
for details on hashsums and modified time handling.

#### No metadata

You can disable meta objects by setting the meta format option to `none`.
In this mode chunker will scan directory for all files that follow
configured chunk name format, group them by detecting chunks with the same
base name and show group names as virtual composite files.
This method is more prone to missing chunk errors (especially missing
last chunk) than format with metadata enabled.


### Hashsums

Chunker supports hashsums only when a compatible metadata is present.
Hence, if you choose metadata format of `none`, chunker will report hashsum
as `UNSUPPORTED`.

Please note that by default metadata is stored only for composite files.
If a file is smaller than configured chunk size, chunker will transparently
redirect hash requests to wrapped remote, so support depends on that.
You will see the empty string as a hashsum of requested type for small
files if the wrapped remote doesn't support it.

Many storage backends support MD5 and SHA1 hash types, so does chunker.
With chunker you can choose one or another but not both.
MD5 is set by default as the most supported type.
Since chunker keeps hashes for composite files and falls back to the
wrapped remote hash for non-chunked ones, we advise you to choose the same
hash type as supported by wrapped remote so that your file listings
look coherent.

If your storage backend does not support MD5 or SHA1 but you need consistent
file hashing, configure chunker with `md5all` or `sha1all`. These two modes
guarantee given hash for all files. If wrapped remote doesn't support it,
chunker will then add metadata to all files, even small. However, this can
double the amount of small files in storage and incur additional service charges.
You can even use chunker to force md5/sha1 support in any other remote
at expense of sidecar meta objects by setting e.g. `chunk_type=sha1all`
to force hashsums and `chunk_size=1P` to effectively disable chunking.

Normally, when a file is copied to chunker controlled remote, chunker
will ask the file source for compatible file hash and revert to on-the-fly
calculation if none is found. This involves some CPU overhead but provides
a guarantee that given hashsum is available. Also, chunker will reject
a server-side copy or move operation if source and destination hashsum
types are different resulting in the extra network bandwidth, too.
In some rare cases this may be undesired, so chunker provides two optional
choices: `sha1quick` and `md5quick`. If the source does not support primary
hash type and the quick mode is enabled, chunker will try to fall back to
the secondary type. This will save CPU and bandwidth but can result in empty
hashsums at destination. Beware of consequences: the `sync` command will
revert (sometimes silently) to time/size comparison if compatible hashsums
between source and target are not found.


### Modified time

Chunker stores modification times using the wrapped remote so support
depends on that. For a small non-chunked file the chunker overlay simply
manipulates modification time of the wrapped remote file.
For a composite file with metadata chunker will get and set
modification time of the metadata object on the wrapped remote.
If file is chunked but metadata format is `none` then chunker will
use modification time of the first data chunk.


### Migrations

The idiomatic way to migrate to a different chunk size, hash type, transaction
style or chunk naming scheme is to:

- Collect all your chunked files under a directory and have your
  chunker remote point to it.
- Create another directory (most probably on the same cloud storage)
  and configure a new remote with desired metadata format,
  hash type, chunk naming etc.
- Now run `rclone sync -i oldchunks: newchunks:` and all your data
  will be transparently converted in transfer.
  This may take some time, yet chunker will try server-side
  copy if possible.
- After checking data integrity you may remove configuration section
  of the old remote.

If rclone gets killed during a long operation on a big composite file,
hidden temporary chunks may stay in the directory. They will not be
shown by the `list` command but will eat up your account quota.
Please note that the `deletefile` command deletes only active
chunks of a file. As a workaround, you can use remote of the wrapped
file system to see them.
An easy way to get rid of hidden garbage is to copy littered directory
somewhere using the chunker remote and purge the original directory.
The `copy` command will copy only active chunks while the `purge` will
remove everything including garbage.


### Caveats and Limitations

Chunker requires wrapped remote to support server-side `move` (or `copy` +
`delete`) operations, otherwise it will explicitly refuse to start.
This is because it internally renames temporary chunk files to their final
names when an operation completes successfully.

Chunker encodes chunk number in file name, so with default `name_format`
setting it adds 17 characters. Also chunker adds 7 characters of temporary
suffix during operations. Many file systems limit base file name without path
by 255 characters. Using rclone's crypt remote as a base file system limits
file name by 143 characters. Thus, maximum name length is 231 for most files
and 119 for chunker-over-crypt. A user in need can change name format to
e.g. `*.rcc##` and save 10 characters (provided at most 99 chunks per file).

Note that a move implemented using the copy-and-delete method may incur
double charging with some cloud storage providers.

Chunker will not automatically rename existing chunks when you run
`rclone config` on a live remote and change the chunk name format.
Beware that in result of this some files which have been treated as chunks
before the change can pop up in directory listings as normal files
and vice versa. The same warning holds for the chunk size.
If you desperately need to change critical chunking settings, you should
run data migration as described above.

If wrapped remote is case insensitive, the chunker overlay will inherit
that property (so you can't have a file called "Hello.doc" and "hello.doc"
in the same directory).

Chunker included in rclone releases up to `v1.54` can sometimes fail to
detect metadata produced by recent versions of rclone. We recommend users
to keep rclone up-to-date to avoid data corruption.

Changing `transactions` is dangerous and requires explicit migration.

        - Metadata is required for no rename transactions (meta format cannot be "none").
        - If you are using norename transactions you should be careful not to downgrade Rclone
        - as older versions of Rclone don't support this transaction style and will misinterpret
        - files manipulated by norename transactions.
        - This method is EXPERIMENTAL, don't use on production systems.
    - "auto"
        - Rename or norename will be used depending on capabilities of the backend.

#  Citrix ShareFile

[Citrix ShareFile](https://sharefile.com) is a secure file sharing and transfer service aimed as business.

## Configuration

The initial setup for Citrix ShareFile involves getting a token from
Citrix ShareFile which you can in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
XX / Citrix Sharefile
   \ "sharefile"
Storage> sharefile
** See help for sharefile backend at: https://rclone.org/sharefile/ **

ID of the root folder

Leave blank to access "Personal Folders".  You can use one of the
standard values here or any folder ID (long hex number ID).
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Access the Personal Folders. (Default)
   \ ""
 2 / Access the Favorites folder.
   \ "favorites"
 3 / Access all the shared folders.
   \ "allshared"
 4 / Access all the individual connectors.
   \ "connectors"
 5 / Access the home, favorites, and shared folders as well as the connectors.
   \ "top"

 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth?state=XXX
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
type = sharefile
endpoint = https://XXX.sharefile.com
token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-09-30T19:41:45.878561877+01:00"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Citrix ShareFile. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your ShareFile

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your ShareFile

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an ShareFile directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modified time and hashes

ShareFile allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

ShareFile supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

### Transfers

For files above 128 MiB rclone will use a chunked transfer.  Rclone will
upload up to `--transfers` chunks at the same time (shared among all
the multipart uploads).  Chunks are buffered in memory and are
normally 64 MiB so increasing `--transfers` will increase memory use.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \\        | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊           |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜           |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞           |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？           |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：           |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |

File names can also not start or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the
name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| .         | 0x2E  | ．           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to sharefile (Citrix Sharefile).

#### --sharefile-root-folder-id

ID of the root folder.

Leave blank to access "Personal Folders".  You can use one of the
standard values here or any folder ID (long hex number ID).

- Config:      root_folder_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SHAREFILE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - Access the Personal Folders (default).
    - "favorites"
        - Access the Favorites folder.
    - "allshared"
        - Access all the shared folders.
    - "connectors"
        - Access all the individual connectors.
    - "top"

- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     128Mi

#### --sharefile-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Must a power of 2 >= 256k.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk
is buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SHAREFILE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix

This is usually auto discovered as part of the oauth process, but can
be set manually to something like: https://XXX.sharefile.com


- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SHAREFILE_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sharefile-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SHAREFILE_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Ctl,LeftSpace,LeftPeriod,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot


## Limitations

Note that ShareFile is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

ShareFile only supports filenames up to 256 characters in length.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Citrix ShareFile backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

# Crypt

Rclone `crypt` remotes encrypt and decrypt other remotes.

A remote of type `crypt` does not access a [storage system](https://rclone.org/overview/)
directly, but instead wraps another remote, which in turn accesses
the storage system. This is similar to how [alias](https://rclone.org/alias/),
[union](https://rclone.org/union/), [chunker](https://rclone.org/chunker/)
and a few others work. It makes the usage very flexible, as you can
add a layer, in this case an encryption layer, on top of any other
backend, even in multiple layers. Rclone's functionality
can be used as with any other remote, for example you can
[mount](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/) a crypt remote.

Accessing a storage system through a crypt remote realizes client-side
encryption, which makes it safe to keep your data in a location you do
not trust will not get compromised.
When working against the `crypt` remote, rclone will automatically
encrypt (before uploading) and decrypt (after downloading) on your local
system as needed on the fly, leaving the data encrypted at rest in the
wrapped remote. If you access the storage system using an application
other than rclone, or access the wrapped remote directly using rclone,
there will not be any encryption/decryption: Downloading existing content
will just give you the encrypted (scrambled) format, and anything you
upload will *not* become encrypted.

The encryption is a secret-key encryption (also called symmetric key encryption)
algorithm, where a password (or pass phrase) is used to generate real encryption key.
The password can be supplied by user, or you may chose to let rclone
generate one. It will be stored in the configuration file, in a lightly obscured form.
If you are in an environment where you are not able to keep your configuration
secured, you should add
[configuration encryption](https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption)
as protection. As long as you have this configuration file, you will be able to
decrypt your data. Without the configuration file, as long as you remember
the password (or keep it in a safe place), you can re-create the configuration
and gain access to the existing data. You may also configure a corresponding
remote in a different installation to access the same data.
See below for guidance to [changing password](#changing-password).

Encryption uses [cryptographic salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)),
to permute the encryption key so that the same string may be encrypted in
different ways. When configuring the crypt remote it is optional to enter a salt,
or to let rclone generate a unique salt. If omitted, rclone uses a built-in unique string.
Normally in cryptography, the salt is stored together with the encrypted content,
and do not have to be memorized by the user. This is not the case in rclone,
because rclone does not store any additional information on the remotes. Use of
custom salt is effectively a second password that must be memorized.

[File content](#file-encryption) encryption is performed using
[NaCl SecretBox](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox),
based on XSalsa20 cipher and Poly1305 for integrity.
[Names](#name-encryption) (file- and directory names) are also encrypted
by default, but this has some implications and is therefore
possible to turned off.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `secret`.

To use `crypt`, first set up the underlying remote. Follow the
`rclone config` instructions for the specific backend.

Before configuring the crypt remote, check the underlying remote is
working. In this example the underlying remote is called `remote`.
We will configure a path `path` within this remote to contain the
encrypted content. Anything inside `remote:path` will be encrypted
and anything outside will not.

Configure `crypt` using `rclone config`. In this example the `crypt`
remote is called `secret`, to differentiate it from the underlying
`remote`.

When you are done you can use the crypt remote named `secret` just
as you would with any other remote, e.g. `rclone copy D:\docs secret:\docs`,
and rclone will encrypt and decrypt as needed on the fly.
If you access the wrapped remote `remote:path` directly you will bypass
the encryption, and anything you read will be in encrypted form, and
anything you write will be unencrypted. To avoid issues it is best to
configure a dedicated path for encrypted content, and access it
exclusively through a crypt remote.

```

**Important** The crypt password stored in `rclone.conf` is lightly
obscured. That only protects it from cursory inspection. It is not
secure unless [configuration encryption](https://rclone.org/docs/#configuration-encryption) of `rclone.conf` is specified.

A long passphrase is recommended, or `rclone config` can generate a
random one.

The obscured password is created using AES-CTR with a static key. The
salt is stored verbatim at the beginning of the obscured password. This
static key is shared between all versions of rclone.

If you reconfigure rclone with the same passwords/passphrases
elsewhere it will be compatible, but the obscured version will be different
due to the different salt.

Rclone does not encrypt

  * file length - this can be calculated within 16 bytes
  * modification time - used for syncing

### Specifying the remote

When configuring the remote to encrypt/decrypt, you may specify any
string that rclone accepts as a source/destination of other commands.

The primary use case is to specify the path into an already configured
remote (e.g. `remote:path/to/dir` or `remote:bucket`), such that
data in a remote untrusted location can be stored encrypted.

You may also specify a local filesystem path, such as
`/path/to/dir` on Linux, `C:\path\to\dir` on Windows. By creating
a crypt remote pointing to such a local filesystem path, you can
use rclone as a utility for pure local file encryption, for example
to keep encrypted files on a removable USB drive.

**Note**: A string which do not contain a `:` will by rclone be treated
as a relative path in the local filesystem. For example, if you enter
the name `remote` without the trailing `:`, it will be treated as
a subdirectory of the current directory with name "remote".

If a path `remote:path/to/dir` is specified, rclone stores encrypted
files in `path/to/dir` on the remote. With file name encryption, files
saved to `secret:subdir/subfile` are stored in the unencrypted path
`path/to/dir` but the `subdir/subpath` element is encrypted.

The path you specify does not have to exist, rclone will create
it when needed.

If you intend to use the wrapped remote both directly for keeping
unencrypted content, as well as through a crypt remote for encrypted
content, it is recommended to point the crypt remote to a separate
directory within the wrapped remote. If you use a bucket based storage
system (e.g. Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2, Hubic) it is generally
advisable to wrap the crypt remote around a specific bucket (`s3:bucket`).
If wrapping around the entire root of the storage (`s3:`), and use the
optional file name encryption, rclone will encrypt the bucket name.

### Changing password

Should the password, or the configuration file containing a lightly obscured
form of the password, be compromised, you need to re-encrypt your data with
a new password. Since rclone uses secret-key encryption, where the encryption
key is generated directly from the password kept on the client, it is not
possible to change the password/key of already encrypted content. Just changing
the password configured for an existing crypt remote means you will no longer
able to decrypt any of the previously encrypted content. The only possibility
is to re-upload everything via a crypt remote configured with your new password.

Depending on the size of your data, your bandwith, storage quota etc, there are
different approaches you can take:
- If you have everything in a different location, for example on your local system,
you could remove all of the prior encrypted files, change the password for your
configured crypt remote (or delete and re-create the crypt configuration),
and then re-upload everything from the alternative location.
- If you have enough space on the storage system you can create a new crypt
remote pointing to a separate directory on the same backend, and then use
rclone to copy everything from the original crypt remote to the new,
effectively decrypting everything on the fly using the old password and
re-encrypting using the new password. When done, delete the original crypt
remote directory and finally the rclone crypt configuration with the old password.
All data will be streamed from the storage system and back, so you will
get half the bandwith and be charged twice if you have upload and download quota
on the storage system.

**Note**: A security problem related to the random password generator
was fixed in rclone version 1.53.3 (released 2020-11-19). Passwords generated
by rclone config in version 1.49.0 (released 2019-08-26) to 1.53.2
(released 2020-10-26) are not considered secure and should be changed.
If you made up your own password, or used rclone version older than 1.49.0 or
newer than 1.53.2 to generate it, you are *not* affected by this issue.
See [issue #4783](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/4783) for more
details, and a tool you can use to check if you are affected.

### Example

Create the following file structure using "standard" file name
encryption.

```
plaintext/
├── file0.txt
├── file1.txt
└── subdir
    ├── file2.txt
    ├── file3.txt
    └── subsubdir
        └── file4.txt
```

Copy these to the remote, and list them

```
$ rclone -q copy plaintext secret:
$ rclone -q ls secret:
        7 file1.txt
        6 file0.txt
        8 subdir/file2.txt
       10 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt
        9 subdir/file3.txt
```

The crypt remote looks like

```
$ rclone -q ls remote:path
       55 hagjclgavj2mbiqm6u6cnjjqcg
       54 v05749mltvv1tf4onltun46gls
       57 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/dlj7fkq4kdq72emafg7a7s41uo
       58 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/7uu829995du6o42n32otfhjqp4/b9pausrfansjth5ob3jkdqd4lc
       56 86vhrsv86mpbtd3a0akjuqslj8/8njh1sk437gttmep3p70g81aps
```

The directory structure is preserved

```
$ rclone -q ls secret:subdir
        8 file2.txt
        9 file3.txt
       10 subsubdir/file4.txt
```

Without file name encryption `.bin` extensions are added to underlying
names. This prevents the cloud provider attempting to interpret file
content.

```
$ rclone -q ls remote:path
       54 file0.txt.bin
       57 subdir/file3.txt.bin
       56 subdir/file2.txt.bin
       58 subdir/subsubdir/file4.txt.bin
       55 file1.txt.bin
```

### File name encryption modes

Off

  * doesn't hide file names or directory structure
  * allows for longer file names (~246 characters)
  * can use sub paths and copy single files

Standard

  * file names encrypted
  * file names can't be as long (~143 characters)
  * can use sub paths and copy single files
  * directory structure visible
  * identical files names will have identical uploaded names
  * can use shortcuts to shorten the directory recursion

Obfuscation

This is a simple "rotate" of the filename, with each file having a rot
distance based on the filename. Rclone stores the distance at the
beginning of the filename. A file called "hello" may become "53.jgnnq".

Obfuscation is not a strong encryption of filenames, but hinders
automated scanning tools picking up on filename patterns. It is an
intermediate between "off" and "standard" which allows for longer path
segment names.

There is a possibility with some unicode based filenames that the
obfuscation is weak and may map lower case characters to upper case
equivalents.

Obfuscation cannot be relied upon for strong protection.

  * file names very lightly obfuscated
  * file names can be longer than standard encryption
  * can use sub paths and copy single files
  * directory structure visible
  * identical files names will have identical uploaded names

Cloud storage systems have limits on file name length and
total path length which rclone is more likely to breach using
"Standard" file name encryption.  Where file names are less thn 156
characters in length issues should not be encountered, irrespective of
cloud storage provider.

An alternative, future rclone file name encryption mode may tolerate
backend provider path length limits.

### Directory name encryption

Crypt offers the option of encrypting dir names or leaving them intact.
There are two options:

True

Encrypts the whole file path including directory names
Example:
`1/12/123.txt` is encrypted to
`p0e52nreeaj0a5ea7s64m4j72s/l42g6771hnv3an9cgc8cr2n1ng/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0`

False

Only encrypts file names, skips directory names
Example:
`1/12/123.txt` is encrypted to
`1/12/qgm4avr35m5loi1th53ato71v0`


### Modified time and hashes

Crypt stores modification times using the underlying remote so support
depends on that.

Hashes are not stored for crypt. However the data integrity is
protected by an extremely strong crypto authenticator.

Use the `rclone cryptcheck` command to check the
integrity of a crypted remote instead of `rclone check` which can't
check the checksums properly.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a remote).

#### --crypt-remote

Remote to encrypt/decrypt.

Normally should contain a ':' and a path, e.g. "myremote:path/to/dir",
"myremote:bucket" or maybe "myremote:" (not recommended).

- Config:      remote
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_REMOTE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --crypt-filename-encryption

How to encrypt the filenames.

- Config:      filename_encryption
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_FILENAME_ENCRYPTION
- Type:        string
- Default:     "standard"
- Examples:
    - "standard"
        - Encrypt the filenames.
        - See the docs for the details.
    - "obfuscate"
        - Very simple filename obfuscation.
    - "off"
        - Don't encrypt the file names.
        - Adds a ".bin" extension only.

#### --crypt-directory-name-encryption

Option to either encrypt directory names or leave them intact.

NB If filename_encryption is "off" then this option will do nothing.

- Config:      directory_name_encryption
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_DIRECTORY_NAME_ENCRYPTION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true
- Examples:
    - "true"
        - Encrypt directory names.
    - "false"
        - Don't encrypt directory names, leave them intact.

#### --crypt-password

Password or pass phrase for encryption.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --crypt-password2

Password or pass phrase for salt.

Optional but recommended.
Should be different to the previous password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      password2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_PASSWORD2
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to crypt (Encrypt/Decrypt a remote).

#### --crypt-server-side-across-configs

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different crypt configs.

Normally this option is not what you want, but if you have two crypts
pointing to the same backend you can use it.

This can be used, for example, to change file name encryption type
without re-uploading all the data. Just make two crypt backends
pointing to two different directories with the single changed
parameter and use rclone move to move the files between the crypt
remotes.

- Config:      server_side_across_configs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --crypt-show-mapping

For all files listed show how the names encrypt.

If this flag is set then for each file that the remote is asked to
list, it will log (at level INFO) a line stating the decrypted file
name and the encrypted file name.

This is so you can work out which encrypted names are which decrypted
names just in case you need to do something with the encrypted file
names, or for debugging purposes.

- Config:      show_mapping
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_SHOW_MAPPING
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --crypt-no-data-encryption

Option to either encrypt file data or leave it unencrypted.

- Config:      no_data_encryption
- Env Var:     RCLONE_CRYPT_NO_DATA_ENCRYPTION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "true"
        - Don't encrypt file data, leave it unencrypted.
    - "false"
        - Encrypt file data.

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the crypt backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See [the "rclone backend" command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend/command).

### encode

Encode the given filename(s)

    rclone backend encode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This encodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the encoded results.

Usage Example:

    rclone backend encode crypt: file1 [file2...]
    rclone rc backend/command command=encode fs=crypt: file1 [file2...]


### decode

Decode the given filename(s)

    rclone backend decode remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This decodes the filenames given as arguments returning a list of
strings of the decoded results. It will return an error if any of the
inputs are invalid.

Usage Example:

    rclone backend decode crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]
    rclone rc backend/command command=decode fs=crypt: encryptedfile1 [encryptedfile2...]




## Backing up a crypted remote

If you wish to backup a crypted remote, it is recommended that you use
`rclone sync` on the encrypted files, and make sure the passwords are
the same in the new encrypted remote.

This will have the following advantages

  * `rclone sync` will check the checksums while copying
  * you can use `rclone check` between the encrypted remotes
  * you don't decrypt and encrypt unnecessarily

For example, let's say you have your original remote at `remote:` with
the encrypted version at `eremote:` with path `remote:crypt`.  You
would then set up the new remote `remote2:` and then the encrypted
version `eremote2:` with path `remote2:crypt` using the same passwords
as `eremote:`.

To sync the two remotes you would do

    rclone sync -i remote:crypt remote2:crypt

And to check the integrity you would do

    rclone check remote:crypt remote2:crypt

## File formats

### File encryption

Files are encrypted 1:1 source file to destination object.  The file
has a header and is divided into chunks.

#### Header

  * 8 bytes magic string `RCLONE\x00\x00`
  * 24 bytes Nonce (IV)

The initial nonce is generated from the operating systems crypto
strong random number generator.  The nonce is incremented for each
chunk read making sure each nonce is unique for each block written.
The chance of a nonce being re-used is minuscule.  If you wrote an
exabyte of data (10¹⁸ bytes) you would have a probability of
approximately 2×10⁻³² of re-using a nonce.

#### Chunk

Each chunk will contain 64 KiB of data, except for the last one which
may have less data. The data chunk is in standard NaCl SecretBox
format. SecretBox uses XSalsa20 and Poly1305 to encrypt and
authenticate messages.

Each chunk contains:

  * 16 Bytes of Poly1305 authenticator
  * 1 - 65536 bytes XSalsa20 encrypted data

64k chunk size was chosen as the best performing chunk size (the
authenticator takes too much time below this and the performance drops
off due to cache effects above this).  Note that these chunks are
buffered in memory so they can't be too big.

This uses a 32 byte (256 bit key) key derived from the user password.

#### Examples

1 byte file will encrypt to

  * 32 bytes header
  * 17 bytes data chunk

49 bytes total

1 MiB (1048576 bytes) file will encrypt to

  * 32 bytes header
  * 16 chunks of 65568 bytes

1049120 bytes total (a 0.05% overhead). This is the overhead for big
files.

### Name encryption

File names are encrypted segment by segment - the path is broken up
into `/` separated strings and these are encrypted individually.

File segments are padded using PKCS#7 to a multiple of 16 bytes
before encryption.

They are then encrypted with EME using AES with 256 bit key. EME
(ECB-Mix-ECB) is a wide-block encryption mode presented in the 2003
paper "A Parallelizable Enciphering Mode" by Halevi and Rogaway.

This makes for deterministic encryption which is what we want - the
same filename must encrypt to the same thing otherwise we can't find
it on the cloud storage system.

This means that

  * filenames with the same name will encrypt the same
  * filenames which start the same won't have a common prefix

This uses a 32 byte key (256 bits) and a 16 byte (128 bits) IV both of
which are derived from the user password.

After encryption they are written out using a modified version of
standard `base32` encoding as described in RFC4648.  The standard
encoding is modified in two ways:

  * it becomes lower case (no-one likes upper case filenames!)
  * we strip the padding character `=`

`base32` is used rather than the more efficient `base64` so rclone can be
used on case insensitive remotes (e.g. Windows, Amazon Drive).

### Key derivation

Rclone uses `scrypt` with parameters `N=16384, r=8, p=1` with an
optional user supplied salt (password2) to derive the 32+32+16 = 80
bytes of key material required.  If the user doesn't supply a salt
then rclone uses an internal one.

`scrypt` makes it impractical to mount a dictionary attack on rclone
encrypted data.  For full protection against this you should always use
a salt.

# Compress (Experimental)

## Warning

This remote is currently **experimental**. Things may break and data may be lost. Anything you do with this remote is
at your own risk. Please understand the risks associated with using experimental code and don't use this remote in
critical applications.

The `Compress` remote adds compression to another remote. It is best used with remotes containing
many large compressible files.

## Configuration

To use this remote, all you need to do is specify another remote and a compression mode to use:

```
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote_to_press      sometype

e) Edit existing remote
$ rclone config
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote

type = compress
remote = remote_to_press:subdir
compression_mode = gzip
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Compression Modes

Currently only gzip compression is supported. It provides a decent balance between speed and size and is well
supported by other applications. Compression strength can further be configured via an advanced setting where 0 is no
compression and 9 is strongest compression.

### File types

If you open a remote wrapped by compress, you will see that there are many files with an extension corresponding to
the compression algorithm you chose. These files are standard files that can be opened by various archive programs, 
but they have some hidden metadata that allows them to be used by rclone.
While you may download and decompress these files at will, do **not** manually delete or rename files. Files without
correct metadata files will not be recognized by rclone.

### File names

The compressed files will be named `*.###########.gz` where `*` is the base file and the `#` part is base64 encoded 
size of the uncompressed file. The file names should not be changed by anything other than the rclone compression backend.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to compress (Compress a remote).

#### --compress-remote

Remote to compress.

- Config:      remote
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_REMOTE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --compress-mode

Compression mode.

- Config:      mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_MODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "gzip"
- Examples:
    - "gzip"
        - Standard gzip compression with fastest parameters.

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to compress (Compress a remote).

#### --compress-level

GZIP compression level (-2 to 9).

Generally -1 (default, equivalent to 5) is recommended.
Levels 1 to 9 increase compression at the cost of speed. Going past 6 
generally offers very little return.

Level -2 uses Huffmann encoding only. Only use if you know what you
are doing.
Level 0 turns off compression.

- Config:      level
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_LEVEL
- Type:        int
- Default:     -1

#### --compress-ram-cache-limit

Some remotes don't allow the upload of files with unknown size.
In this case the compressed file will need to be cached to determine
it's size.

Files smaller than this limit will be cached in RAM, files larger than 
this limit will be cached on disk.

- Config:      ram_cache_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_COMPRESS_RAM_CACHE_LIMIT
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     20Mi



#  Dropbox

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Dropbox paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
`remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
q) Quit config
e/n/d/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Dropbox
   \ "dropbox"
[snip]
Storage> dropbox
Dropbox App Key - leave blank normally.
app_key>
Dropbox App Secret - leave blank normally.
app_secret>
Remote config
Please visit:
https://www.dropbox.com/1/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&response_type=code
Enter the code: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXX
--------------------
[remote]
app_key =
app_secret =
token = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your dropbox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your dropbox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a dropbox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Dropbox for business

Rclone supports Dropbox for business and Team Folders.

When using Dropbox for business `remote:` and `remote:path/to/file`
will refer to your personal folder.

If you wish to see Team Folders you must use a leading `/` in the
path, so `rclone lsd remote:/` will refer to the root and show you all
Team Folders and your User Folder.

You can then use team folders like this `remote:/TeamFolder` and
`remote:/TeamFolder/path/to/file`.

A leading `/` for a Dropbox personal account will do nothing, but it
will take an extra HTTP transaction so it should be avoided.

### Modified time and Hashes

Dropbox supports modified times, but the only way to set a
modification time is to re-upload the file.

This means that if you uploaded your data with an older version of
rclone which didn't support the v2 API and modified times, rclone will
decide to upload all your old data to fix the modification times.  If
you don't want this to happen use `--size-only` or `--checksum` flag
to stop it.

Dropbox supports [its own hash
type](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/content-hash) which
is checked for all transfers.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |
| DEL       | 0x7F  | ␡           |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Batch mode uploads {#batch-mode}

Using batch mode uploads is very important for performance when using
the Dropbox API. See [the dropbox performance guide](https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-performance-guide)
for more info.

There are 3 modes rclone can use for uploads.

#### --dropbox-batch-mode off

In this mode rclone will not use upload batching. This was the default
before rclone v1.55. It has the disadvantage that it is very likely to
encounter `too_many_requests` errors like this

    NOTICE: too_many_requests/.: Too many requests or write operations. Trying again in 15 seconds.

When rclone receives these it has to wait for 15s or sometimes 300s
before continuing which really slows down transfers.

This will happen especially if `--transfers` is large, so this mode
isn't recommended except for compatibility or investigating problems.

#### --dropbox-batch-mode sync

In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
`--dropbox-batch-size` and commit them together.

Using this mode means you can use a much higher `--transfers`
parameter (32 or 64 works fine) without receiving `too_many_requests`
errors.

This mode ensures full data integrity.

Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.

#### --dropbox-batch-mode async

In this mode rclone will batch up uploads to the size specified by
`--dropbox-batch-size` and commit them together.

However it will not wait for the status of the batch to be returned to
the caller. This means rclone can use a much bigger batch size (much
bigger than `--transfers`), at the cost of not being able to check the
status of the upload.

This provides the maximum possible upload speed especially with lots
of small files, however rclone can't check the file got uploaded
properly using this mode.

If you are using this mode then using "rclone check" after the
transfer completes is recommended. Or you could do an initial transfer
with `--dropbox-batch-mode async` then do a final transfer with
`--dropbox-batch-mode sync` (the default).

Note that there may be a pause when quitting rclone while rclone
finishes up the last batch using this mode.



### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

#### --dropbox-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --dropbox-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      client_secret
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to dropbox (Dropbox).

#### --dropbox-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

- Config:      token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --dropbox-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --dropbox-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --dropbox-chunk-size

Upload chunk size (< 150Mi).

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of this size.

Note that chunks are buffered in memory (one at a time) so rclone can
deal with retries.  Setting this larger will increase the speed
slightly (at most 10% for 128 MiB in tests) at the cost of using more
memory.  It can be set smaller if you are tight on memory.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     48Mi

#### --dropbox-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a business account.

Note that if you want to use impersonate, you should make sure this
flag is set when running "rclone config" as this will cause rclone to
request the "members.read" scope which it won't normally. This is
needed to lookup a members email address into the internal ID that
dropbox uses in the API.

Using the "members.read" scope will require a Dropbox Team Admin
to approve during the OAuth flow.

You will have to use your own App (setting your own client_id and
client_secret) to use this option as currently rclone's default set of
permissions doesn't include "members.read". This can be added once
v1.55 or later is in use everywhere.


- Config:      impersonate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_IMPERSONATE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --dropbox-shared-files

Instructs rclone to work on individual shared files.

In this mode rclone's features are extremely limited - only list (ls, lsl, etc.) 
operations and read operations (e.g. downloading) are supported in this mode.
All other operations will be disabled.

- Config:      shared_files
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FILES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --dropbox-shared-folders

Instructs rclone to work on shared folders.
			
When this flag is used with no path only the List operation is supported and 
all available shared folders will be listed. If you specify a path the first part 
will be interpreted as the name of shared folder. Rclone will then try to mount this 
shared to the root namespace. On success shared folder rclone proceeds normally. 
The shared folder is now pretty much a normal folder and all normal operations 
are supported. 

Note that we don't unmount the shared folder afterwards so the 
--dropbox-shared-folders can be omitted after the first use of a particular 
shared folder.

- Config:      shared_folders
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_SHARED_FOLDERS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --dropbox-batch-mode

Upload file batching sync|async|off.

This sets the batch mode used by rclone.

For full info see [the main docs](https://rclone.org/dropbox/#batch-mode)

This has 3 possible values

- off - no batching
- sync - batch uploads and check completion (default)
- async - batch upload and don't check completion

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.


- Config:      batch_mode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_MODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "sync"

#### --dropbox-batch-size

Max number of files in upload batch.

This sets the batch size of files to upload. It has to be less than 1000.

By default this is 0 which means rclone which calculate the batch size
depending on the setting of batch_mode.

- batch_mode: async - default batch_size is 100
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_size is the same as --transfers
- batch_mode: off - not in use

Rclone will close any outstanding batches when it exits which may make
a delay on quit.

Setting this is a great idea if you are uploading lots of small files
as it will make them a lot quicker. You can use --transfers 32 to
maximise throughput.


- Config:      batch_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_SIZE
- Type:        int
- Default:     0

#### --dropbox-batch-timeout

Max time to allow an idle upload batch before uploading.

If an upload batch is idle for more than this long then it will be
uploaded.

The default for this is 0 which means rclone will choose a sensible
default based on the batch_mode in use.

- batch_mode: async - default batch_timeout is 500ms
- batch_mode: sync - default batch_timeout is 10s
- batch_mode: off - not in use


- Config:      batch_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     0s

#### --dropbox-batch-commit-timeout

Max time to wait for a batch to finish comitting

- Config:      batch_commit_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_BATCH_COMMIT_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     10m0s

#### --dropbox-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DROPBOX_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,RightSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Note that Dropbox is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are some file names such as `thumbs.db` which Dropbox can't
store.  There is a full list of them in the ["Ignored Files" section
of this document](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/145).  Rclone will
issue an error message `File name disallowed - not uploading` if it
attempts to upload one of those file names, but the sync won't fail.

Some errors may occur if you try to sync copyright-protected files
because Dropbox has its own [copyright detector](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/30/how-dropbox-knows-when-youre-sharing-copyrighted-stuff-without-actually-looking-at-your-stuff/) that
prevents this sort of file being downloaded. This will return the error `ERROR :
/path/to/your/file: Failed to copy: failed to open source object:
path/restricted_content/.`

If you have more than 10,000 files in a directory then `rclone purge
dropbox:dir` will return the error `Failed to purge: There are too
many files involved in this operation`.  As a work-around do an
`rclone delete dropbox:dir` followed by an `rclone rmdir dropbox:dir`.

When using `rclone link` you'll need to set `--expire` if using a
non-personal account otherwise the visibility may not be correct.
(Note that `--expire` isn't supported on personal accounts). See the
[forum discussion](https://forum.rclone.org/t/rclone-link-dropbox-permissions/23211) and the 
[dropbox SDK issue](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-sdk-go-unofficial/issues/75).

## Get your own Dropbox App ID

When you use rclone with Dropbox in its default configuration you are using rclone's App ID. This is shared between all the rclone users.

Here is how to create your own Dropbox App ID for rclone:

1. Log into the [Dropbox App console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) with your Dropbox Account (It need not
to be the same account as the Dropbox you want to access)

2. Choose an API => Usually this should be `Dropbox API`

3. Choose the type of access you want to use => `Full Dropbox` or `App Folder`

4. Name your App. The app name is global, so you can't use `rclone` for example

5. Click the button `Create App`

6. Switch to the `Permissions` tab. Enable at least the following permissions: `account_info.read`, `files.metadata.write`, `files.content.write`, `files.content.read`, `sharing.write`. The `files.metadata.read` and `sharing.read` checkboxes will be marked too. Click `Submit`

7. Switch to the `Settings` tab. Fill `OAuth2 - Redirect URIs` as `http://localhost:53682/`

8. Find the `App key` and `App secret` values on the `Settings` tab. Use these values in rclone config to add a new remote or edit an existing remote. The `App key` setting corresponds to `client_id` in rclone config, the `App secret` corresponds to `client_secret`

#  Enterprise File Fabric

This backend supports [Storage Made Easy's Enterprise File
Fabric™](https://storagemadeeasy.com/about/) which provides a software
solution to integrate and unify File and Object Storage accessible
through a global file system.

## Configuration

The initial setup for the Enterprise File Fabric backend involves
getting a token from the the Enterprise File Fabric which you need to
do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Storage Made Easy US
   \ "https://storagemadeeasy.com"
 2 / Storage Made Easy EU

ID of the root folder
Leave blank normally.

Fill in to make rclone start with directory of a given ID.

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
root_folder_id> 
Permanent Authentication Token

A Permanent Authentication Token can be created in the Enterprise File
Fabric, on the users Dashboard under Security, there is an entry
you'll see called "My Authentication Tokens". Click the Manage button
to create one.

These tokens are normally valid for several years.

For more info see: https://docs.storagemadeeasy.com/organisationcloud/api-tokens

Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
permanent_token> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
type = filefabric
url = https://yourfabric.smestorage.com/
permanent_token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Enterprise File Fabric

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Enterprise File Fabric

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Enterprise File Fabric directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes

The Enterprise File Fabric allows modification times to be set on
files accurate to 1 second.  These will be used to detect whether
objects need syncing or not.

The Enterprise File Fabric does not support any data hashes at this time.

### Restricted filename characters

The [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
will be replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Empty files

Empty files aren't supported by the Enterprise File Fabric. Rclone will therefore
upload an empty file as a single space with a mime type of
`application/vnd.rclone.empty.file` and files with that mime type are
treated as empty.

### Root folder ID ###

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your Enterprise File Fabric.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  These aren't displayed in the
web interface, but you can use `rclone lsf` to find them, for example

```
$ rclone lsf --dirs-only -Fip --csv filefabric:
120673758,Burnt PDFs/
120673759,My Quick Uploads/
120673755,My Syncs/
120673756,My backups/
120673757,My contacts/
120673761,S3 Storage/
```

The ID for "S3 Storage" would be `120673761`.

#  FTP

FTP is the File Transfer Protocol. Rclone FTP support is provided using the
[github.com/jlaffaye/ftp](https://godoc.org/github.com/jlaffaye/ftp)
package.

[Limitations of Rclone's FTP backend](#limitations)

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. If the path does not begin with
a `/` it is relative to the home directory of the user.  An empty path
`remote:` refers to the user's home directory.

## Configuration

To create an FTP configuration named `remote`, run

    rclone config

Rclone config guides you through an interactive setup process. A minimal
rclone FTP remote definition only requires host, username and password.
For an anonymous FTP server, use `anonymous` as username and your email
address as password.

```
No remotes found - make a new one

r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

To see all directories in the home directory of `remote`

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

### Example without a config file ###

    rclone lsf :ftp: --ftp-host=speedtest.tele2.net --ftp-user=anonymous --ftp-pass=`rclone obscure dummy`

### Implicit TLS ###

Rlone FTP supports implicit FTP over TLS servers (FTPS). This has to
be enabled in the FTP backend config for the remote, or with
[`--ftp-tls`](#ftp-tls). The default FTPS port is `990`, not `21` and
can be set with [`--ftp-port`](#ftp-port).

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

File names cannot end with the following characters. Repacement is
limited to the last character in a file name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |

Not all FTP servers can have all characters in file names, for example:

| FTP Server| Forbidden characters |
| --------- |:--------------------:|
| proftpd   | `*`                  |
| pureftpd  | `\ [ ]`              |

This backend's interactive configuration wizard provides a selection of
sensible encoding settings for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd.
Just hit a selection number when prompted.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to ftp (FTP Connection).

#### --ftp-host

FTP host to connect to.

E.g. "ftp.example.com".

- Config:      host
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_HOST
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --ftp-user

FTP username, leave blank for current username, $USER.

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --ftp-port

FTP port, leave blank to use default (21).

- Config:      port
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_PORT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --ftp-pass

FTP password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_PASS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --ftp-tls

Use Implicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).

When using implicit FTP over TLS the client connects using TLS
right from the start which breaks compatibility with
non-TLS-aware servers. This is usually served over port 990 rather
than port 21. Cannot be used in combination with explicit FTP.

- Config:      tls
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_TLS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --ftp-explicit-tls

Use Explicit FTPS (FTP over TLS).

When using explicit FTP over TLS the client explicitly requests
security from the server in order to upgrade a plain text connection
to an encrypted one. Cannot be used in combination with implicit FTP.

- Config:      explicit_tls
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_EXPLICIT_TLS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_WRITING_MDTM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --ftp-idle-timeout

Max time before closing idle connections.

If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time
given, rclone will empty the connection pool.

Set to 0 to keep connections indefinitely.

#### --ftp-tls-cache-size

Size of TLS session cache for all control and data connections.

TLS cache allows to resume TLS sessions and reuse PSK between connections.
Increase if default size is not enough resulting in TLS resumption errors.
Enabled by default. Use 0 to disable.

- Config:      tls_cache_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_TLS_CACHE_SIZE
- Type:        int
- Default:     32

#### --ftp-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_FTP_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,Del,Ctl,RightSpace,Dot
- Examples:
    - "Asterisk,Ctl,Dot,Slash"
        - ProFTPd can't handle '*' in file names
    - "BackSlash,Ctl,Del,Dot,RightSpace,Slash,SquareBracket"
        - PureFTPd can't handle '[]' or '*' in file names
    - "Ctl,LeftPeriod,Slash"
        - VsFTPd can't handle file names starting with dot



## Limitations

FTP servers acting as rclone remotes must support `passive` mode.
The mode cannot be configured as `passive` is the only supported one.
Rclone's FTP implementation is not compatible with `active` mode
as [the library it uses doesn't support it](https://github.com/jlaffaye/ftp/issues/29).
This will likely never be supported due to security concerns.

Rclone's FTP backend does not support any checksums but can compare
file sizes.

`rclone about` is not supported by the FTP backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

The implementation of : `--dump headers`,
`--dump bodies`, `--dump auth` for debugging isn't the same as
for rclone HTTP based backends - it has less fine grained control.

`--timeout` isn't supported (but `--contimeout` is).

`--bind` isn't supported.

Rclone's FTP backend could support server-side move but does not
at present.

The `ftp_proxy` environment variable is not currently supported.

#### Modified time

File modification time (timestamps) is supported to 1 second resolution
for major FTP servers: ProFTPd, PureFTPd, VsFTPd, and FileZilla FTP server.
The `VsFTPd` server has non-standard implementation of time related protocol
commands and needs a special configuration setting: `writing_mdtm = true`.

Support for precise file time with other FTP servers varies depending on what
protocol extensions they advertise. If all the `MLSD`, `MDTM` and `MFTM`
extensions are present, rclone will use them together to provide precise time.
Otherwise the times you see on the FTP server through rclone are those of the
last file upload.

You can use the following command to check whether rclone can use precise time
with your FTP server: `rclone backend features your_ftp_remote:` (the trailing
colon is important). Look for the number in the line tagged by `Precision`
designating the remote time precision expressed as nanoseconds. A value of
`1000000000` means that file time precision of 1 second is available.
A value of `3153600000000000000` (or another large number) means "unsupported".

#  Google Cloud Storage

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from Google Cloud Storage
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the buckets in your project

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Cloud Storage in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful
when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have
actively logged-in users, for example build machines.

To get credentials for Google Cloud Platform
[IAM Service Accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts),
please head to the
[Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/permissions/serviceaccounts)
section of the Google Developer Console. Service Accounts behave just
like normal `User` permissions in
[Google Cloud Storage ACLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control),
so you can limit their access (e.g. make them read only). After
creating an account, a JSON file containing the Service Account's
credentials will be downloaded onto your machines. These credentials
are what rclone will use for authentication.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path
to your Service Account credentials at the `service_account_file`
prompt and rclone won't use the browser based authentication
flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the credentials file into
the rclone config file, you can set `service_account_credentials` with
the actual contents of the file instead, or set the equivalent
environment variable.

### Anonymous Access

For downloads of objects that permit public access you can configure rclone
to use anonymous access by setting `anonymous` to `true`.
With unauthorized access you can't write or create files but only read or list
those buckets and objects that have public read access.

### Application Default Credentials

If no other source of credentials is provided, rclone will fall back
to
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/common/auth#authenticating_with_application_default_credentials)
this is useful both when you already have configured authentication
for your developer account, or in production when running on a google
compute host. Note that if running in docker, you may need to run
additional commands on your google compute machine -
[see this page](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication#gcloud_as_a_docker_credential_helper).

Note that in the case application default credentials are used, there
is no need to explicitly configure a project number.

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Custom upload headers

You can set custom upload headers with the `--header-upload`
flag. Google Cloud Storage supports the headers as described in the
[working with metadata documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/WorkingWithObjectMetadata)

- Cache-Control
- Content-Disposition
- Content-Encoding
- Content-Language
- Content-Type
- X-Goog-Storage-Class
- X-Goog-Meta-

Eg `--header-upload "Content-Type text/potato"`

Note that the last of these is for setting custom metadata in the form
`--header-upload "x-goog-meta-key: value"`

### Modification time

Google Cloud Storage stores md5sum natively.
Google's [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) tool stores modification time
with one-second precision as `goog-reserved-file-mtime` in file metadata.

To ensure compatibility with gsutil, rclone stores modification time in 2 separate metadata entries.
`mtime` uses RFC3339 format with one-nanosecond precision.
`goog-reserved-file-mtime` uses Unix timestamp format with one-second precision.
To get modification time from object metadata, rclone reads the metadata in the following order: `mtime`, `goog-reserved-file-mtime`, object updated time.

Note that rclone's default modify window is 1ns.
Files uploaded by gsutil only contain timestamps with one-second precision.
If you use rclone to sync files previously uploaded by gsutil,
rclone will attempt to update modification time for all these files.
To avoid these possibly unnecessary updates, use `--modify-window 1s`.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| LF        | 0x0A  | ␊           |
| CR        | 0x0D  | ␍           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the Google Cloud Storage backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Google Drive

Paths are specified as `drive:path`

Drive paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `drive:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n

 2 / Read-only access to file metadata and file contents.
   \ "drive.readonly"
   / Access to files created by rclone only.

   | File authorization is revoked when the user deauthorizes the app.
   \ "drive.file"
   / Allows read and write access to the Application Data folder.
 4 | This is not visible in the drive website.
   \ "drive.appfolder"

client_id = 
client_secret = 
scope = drive
root_folder_id = 
service_account_file =
token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2014-03-16T13:57:58.955387075Z"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

You can then use it like this,

List directories in top level of your drive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your drive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Scopes

Rclone allows you to select which scope you would like for rclone to
use.  This changes what type of token is granted to rclone.  [The
scopes are defined
here](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth).

The scope are

#### drive

This is the default scope and allows full access to all files, except
for the Application Data Folder (see below).

Choose this one if you aren't sure.

#### drive.readonly

This allows read only access to all files.  Files may be listed and
downloaded but not uploaded, renamed or deleted.

#### drive.file

With this scope rclone can read/view/modify only those files and
folders it creates.

So if you uploaded files to drive via the web interface (or any other
means) they will not be visible to rclone.

This can be useful if you are using rclone to backup data and you want
to be sure confidential data on your drive is not visible to rclone.

Files created with this scope are visible in the web interface.

#### drive.appfolder

This gives rclone its own private area to store files.  Rclone will
not be able to see any other files on your drive and you won't be able
to see rclone's files from the web interface either.

#### drive.metadata.readonly

This allows read only access to file names only.  It does not allow
rclone to download or upload data, or rename or delete files or
directories.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy or to access data within the "Computers" tab on the drive
web interface (where files from Google's Backup and Sync desktop
program go).

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the last segment
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the drive web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh`
in the browser, then you use `1XyfxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxKHCh` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.

**NB** folders under the "Computers" tab seem to be read only (drive
gives a 500 error) when using rclone.

There doesn't appear to be an API to discover the folder IDs of the
"Computers" tab - please contact us if you know otherwise!

Note also that rclone can't access any data under the "Backups" tab on
the google drive web interface yet.

### Service Account support

You can set up rclone with Google Drive in an unattended mode,
i.e. not tied to a specific end-user Google account. This is useful
when you want to synchronise files onto machines that don't have
actively logged-in users, for example build machines.

To use a Service Account instead of OAuth2 token flow, enter the path
to your Service Account credentials at the `service_account_file`
prompt during `rclone config` and rclone won't use the browser based
authentication flow. If you'd rather stuff the contents of the
credentials file into the rclone config file, you can set
`service_account_credentials` with the actual contents of the file
instead, or set the equivalent environment variable.

#### Use case - Google Apps/G-suite account and individual Drive

Let's say that you are the administrator of a Google Apps (old) or
G-suite account.
The goal is to store data on an individual's Drive account, who IS
a member of the domain.
We'll call the domain **example.com**, and the user
**foo@example.com**.

There's a few steps we need to go through to accomplish this:

##### 1. Create a service account for example.com
  - To create a service account and obtain its credentials, go to the
[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com).
  - You must have a project - create one if you don't.
  - Then go to "IAM & admin" -> "Service Accounts".
  - Use the "Create Credentials" button. Fill in "Service account name"
with something that identifies your client. "Role" can be empty.
  - Tick "Furnish a new private key" - select "Key type JSON".
  - Tick "Enable G Suite Domain-wide Delegation". This option makes
"impersonation" possible, as documented here:
[Delegating domain-wide authority to the service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#delegatingauthority)
  - These credentials are what rclone will use for authentication.
If you ever need to remove access, press the "Delete service
account key" button.

##### 2. Allowing API access to example.com Google Drive
  - Go to example.com's admin console
  - Go into "Security" (or use the search bar)
  - Select "Show more" and then "Advanced settings"
  - Select "Manage API client access" in the "Authentication" section
  - In the "Client Name" field enter the service account's
"Client ID" - this can be found in the Developer Console under
"IAM & Admin" -> "Service Accounts", then "View Client ID" for
the newly created service account.
It is a ~21 character numerical string.
  - In the next field, "One or More API Scopes", enter
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
to grant access to Google Drive specifically.

##### 3. Configure rclone, assuming a new install

```
rclone config

n/s/q> n         # New
name>gdrive      # Gdrive is an example name
Storage>         # Select the number shown for Google Drive
client_id>       # Can be left blank
client_secret>   # Can be left blank
scope>           # Select your scope, 1 for example
root_folder_id>  # Can be left blank
service_account_file> /home/foo/myJSONfile.json # This is where the JSON file goes!
y/n>             # Auto config, n

```

##### 4. Verify that it's working
  - `rclone -v --drive-impersonate foo@example.com lsf gdrive:backup`
  - The arguments do:
    - `-v` - verbose logging
    - `--drive-impersonate foo@example.com` - this is what does
the magic, pretending to be user foo.
    - `lsf` - list files in a parsing friendly way
    - `gdrive:backup` - use the remote called gdrive, work in
the folder named backup.

Note: in case you configured a specific root folder on gdrive and rclone is unable to access the contents of that folder when using `--drive-impersonate`, do this instead:
  - in the gdrive web interface, share your root folder with the user/email of the new Service Account you created/selected at step #1
  - use rclone without specifying the `--drive-impersonate` option, like this:
        `rclone -v lsf gdrive:backup`


### Shared drives (team drives)

If you want to configure the remote to point to a Google Shared Drive
(previously known as Team Drives) then answer `y` to the question
`Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?`.

This will fetch the list of Shared Drives from google and allow you to
configure which one you want to use. You can also type in a Shared
Drive ID if you prefer.

For example:

```
Configure this as a Shared Drive (Team Drive)?
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
Fetching Shared Drive list...
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Rclone Test
   \ "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
 2 / Rclone Test 2
   \ "yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
 3 / Rclone Test 3
   \ "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
Enter a Shared Drive ID> 1
--------------------
[remote]
client_id =
client_secret =
token = {"AccessToken":"xxxx.x.xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","RefreshToken":"1/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx","Expiry":"2014-03-16T13:57:58.955387075Z","Extra":null}
team_drive = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

It does this by combining multiple `list` calls into a single API request.

This works by combining many `'%s' in parents` filters into one expression.
To list the contents of directories a, b and c, the following requests will be send by the regular `List` function:
```
trashed=false and 'a' in parents
trashed=false and 'b' in parents
trashed=false and 'c' in parents
```
These can now be combined into a single request:
```
trashed=false and ('a' in parents or 'b' in parents or 'c' in parents)
```

The implementation of `ListR` will put up to 50 `parents` filters into one request.
It will  use the `--checkers` value to specify the number of requests to run in parallel.

In tests, these batch requests were up to 20x faster than the regular method.
Running the following command against different sized folders gives:
```
rclone lsjson -vv -R --checkers=6 gdrive:folder
```

small folder (220 directories, 700 files):

- without `--fast-list`: 38s
- with `--fast-list`: 10s

large folder (10600 directories, 39000 files):

- without `--fast-list`: 22:05 min
- with `--fast-list`: 58s

### Modified time

Google drive stores modification times accurate to 1 ms.

### Restricted filename characters

Only Invalid UTF-8 bytes will be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

In contrast to other backends, `/` can also be used in names and `.`
or `..` are valid names.

### Revisions

Google drive stores revisions of files.  When you upload a change to
an existing file to google drive using rclone it will create a new
revision of that file.

Revisions follow the standard google policy which at time of writing
was

  * They are deleted after 30 days or 100 revisions (whatever comes first).
  * They do not count towards a user storage quota.

### Deleting files

By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting
files.  If deleting them permanently is required then use the
`--drive-use-trash=false` flag, or set the equivalent environment
variable.

### Shortcuts

In March 2020 Google introduced a new feature in Google Drive called
[drive shortcuts](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9700156)
([API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/shortcuts)). These
will (by September 2020) [replace the ability for files or folders to
be in multiple folders at once](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/simplifying-google-drives-folder-structure-and-sharing-models).

Shortcuts are files that link to other files on Google Drive somewhat
like a symlink in unix, except they point to the underlying file data
(e.g. the inode in unix terms) so they don't break if the source is
renamed or moved about.

Be default rclone treats these as follows.

For shortcuts pointing to files:

- When listing a file shortcut appears as the destination file.
- When downloading the contents of the destination file is downloaded.
- When updating shortcut file with a non shortcut file, the shortcut is removed then a new file is uploaded in place of the shortcut.
- When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the destination file.
- When server-side copying the shortcut is copied, not the contents of the shortcut.
- When deleting the shortcut is deleted not the linked file.
- When setting the modification time, the modification time of the linked file will be set.

For shortcuts pointing to folders:

- When listing the shortcut appears as a folder and that folder will contain the contents of the linked folder appear (including any sub folders)
- When downloading the contents of the linked folder and sub contents are downloaded
- When uploading to a shortcut folder the file will be placed in the linked folder
- When server-side moving (renaming) the shortcut is renamed, not the destination folder
- When server-side copying the contents of the linked folder is copied, not the shortcut.
- When deleting with `rclone rmdir` or `rclone purge` the shortcut is deleted not the linked folder.
- **NB** When deleting with `rclone remove` or `rclone mount` the contents of the linked folder will be deleted.

The [rclone backend](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) command can be used to create shortcuts.  

Shortcuts can be completely ignored with the `--drive-skip-shortcuts` flag
or the corresponding `skip_shortcuts` configuration setting.

### Emptying trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:`
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command
does not take any path arguments.

Note that Google Drive takes some time (minutes to days) to empty the
trash even though the command returns within a few seconds.  No output
is echoed, so there will be no confirmation even using -v or -vv.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota), the usage in Google
Drive, the size of all files in the Trash and the space used by other
Google services such as Gmail. This command does not take any path
arguments.

#### Import/Export of google documents

Google documents can be exported from and uploaded to Google Drive.

When rclone downloads a Google doc it chooses a format to download
depending upon the `--drive-export-formats` setting.
By default the export formats are `docx,xlsx,pptx,svg` which are a
sensible default for an editable document.

When choosing a format, rclone runs down the list provided in order
and chooses the first file format the doc can be exported as from the
list. If the file can't be exported to a format on the formats list,
then rclone will choose a format from the default list.

If you prefer an archive copy then you might use `--drive-export-formats
pdf`, or if you prefer openoffice/libreoffice formats you might use
`--drive-export-formats ods,odt,odp`.

Note that rclone adds the extension to the google doc, so if it is
called `My Spreadsheet` on google docs, it will be exported as `My
Spreadsheet.xlsx` or `My Spreadsheet.pdf` etc.

When importing files into Google Drive, rclone will convert all
files with an extension in `--drive-import-formats` to their
associated document type.
rclone will not convert any files by default, since the conversion
is lossy process.

The conversion must result in a file with the same extension when
the `--drive-export-formats` rules are applied to the uploaded document.

Here are some examples for allowed and prohibited conversions.

| export-formats | import-formats | Upload Ext | Document Ext | Allowed |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| odt | odt | odt | odt | Yes |
| odt | docx,odt | odt | odt | Yes |
|  | docx | docx | docx | Yes |
|  | odt | odt | docx | No |
| odt,docx | docx,odt | docx | odt | No |
| docx,odt | docx,odt | docx | docx | Yes |
| docx,odt | docx,odt | odt | docx | No |

This limitation can be disabled by specifying `--drive-allow-import-name-change`.
When using this flag, rclone can convert multiple files types resulting
in the same document type at once, e.g. with `--drive-import-formats docx,odt,txt`,
all files having these extension would result in a document represented as a docx file.
This brings the additional risk of overwriting a document, if multiple files
have the same stem. Many rclone operations will not handle this name change
in any way. They assume an equal name when copying files and might copy the
file again or delete them when the name changes. 

Here are the possible export extensions with their corresponding mime types.
Most of these can also be used for importing, but there more that are not
listed here. Some of these additional ones might only be available when
the operating system provides the correct MIME type entries.

This list can be changed by Google Drive at any time and might not
represent the currently available conversions.

| Extension | Mime Type | Description |
| --------- |-----------| ------------|
| csv  | text/csv | Standard CSV format for Spreadsheets |
| docx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document | Microsoft Office Document |
| epub | application/epub+zip | E-book format |
| html | text/html | An HTML Document |
| jpg  | image/jpeg | A JPEG Image File |
| json | application/vnd.google-apps.script+json | JSON Text Format |
| odp  | application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.presentation | Openoffice Presentation |
| ods  | application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet | Openoffice Spreadsheet |
| ods  | application/x-vnd.oasis.opendocument.spreadsheet | Openoffice Spreadsheet |
| odt  | application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text | Openoffice Document |
| pdf  | application/pdf | Adobe PDF Format |
| png  | image/png | PNG Image Format|
| pptx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation | Microsoft Office Powerpoint |
| rtf  | application/rtf | Rich Text Format |
| svg  | image/svg+xml | Scalable Vector Graphics Format |
| tsv  | text/tab-separated-values | Standard TSV format for spreadsheets |
| txt  | text/plain | Plain Text |
| xlsx | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet | Microsoft Office Spreadsheet |
| zip  | application/zip | A ZIP file of HTML, Images CSS |

Google documents can also be exported as link files. These files will
open a browser window for the Google Docs website of that document
when opened. The link file extension has to be specified as a
`--drive-export-formats` parameter. They will match all available
Google Documents.

| Extension | Description | OS Support |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| desktop | freedesktop.org specified desktop entry | Linux |
| link.html | An HTML Document with a redirect | All |
| url | INI style link file | macOS, Windows |
| webloc | macOS specific XML format | macOS |

#### --drive-allow-import-name-change

Allow the filetype to change when uploading Google docs.

E.g. file.doc to file.docx. This will confuse sync and reupload every time.

- Config:      allow_import_name_change
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ALLOW_IMPORT_NAME_CHANGE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-use-created-date

Use file created date instead of modified date.

Useful when downloading data and you want the creation date used in
place of the last modified date.

**WARNING**: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

When uploading to your drive all files will be overwritten unless they
haven't been modified since their creation. And the inverse will occur
while downloading.  This side effect can be avoided by using the
"--checksum" flag.

This feature was implemented to retain photos capture date as recorded
by google photos. You will first need to check the "Create a Google
Photos folder" option in your google drive settings. You can then copy
or move the photos locally and use the date the image was taken
(created) set as the modification date.

- Config:      use_created_date
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_CREATED_DATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-use-shared-date

Use date file was shared instead of modified date.

Note that, as with "--drive-use-created-date", this flag may have
unexpected consequences when uploading/downloading files.

If both this flag and "--drive-use-created-date" are set, the created
date is used.

- Config:      use_shared_date
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_USE_SHARED_DATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk 100-1000, 0 to disable.

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --drive-impersonate

Impersonate this user when using a service account.

- Config:      impersonate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_IMPERSONATE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --drive-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     8Mi

#### --drive-chunk-size

Upload chunk size.

Must a power of 2 >= 256k.

Making this larger will improve performance, but note that each chunk
is buffered in memory one per transfer.

Reducing this will reduce memory usage but decrease performance.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     8Mi

#### --drive-acknowledge-abuse

Set to allow files which return cannotDownloadAbusiveFile to be downloaded.

If downloading a file returns the error "This file has been identified
as malware or spam and cannot be downloaded" with the error code
"cannotDownloadAbusiveFile" then supply this flag to rclone to
indicate you acknowledge the risks of downloading the file and rclone
will download it anyway.

- Config:      acknowledge_abuse
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ACKNOWLEDGE_ABUSE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-keep-revision-forever

Keep new head revision of each file forever.

- Config:      keep_revision_forever
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_KEEP_REVISION_FOREVER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-size-as-quota

Show sizes as storage quota usage, not actual size.

Show the size of a file as the storage quota used. This is the
current version plus any older versions that have been set to keep
forever.

**WARNING**: This flag may have some unexpected consequences.

It is not recommended to set this flag in your config - the
recommended usage is using the flag form --drive-size-as-quota when
doing rclone ls/lsl/lsf/lsjson/etc only.

If you do use this flag for syncing (not recommended) then you will
need to use --ignore size also.

- Config:      size_as_quota
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SIZE_AS_QUOTA
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-v2-download-min-size

If Object's are greater, use drive v2 API to download.

- Config:      v2_download_min_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_V2_DOWNLOAD_MIN_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     off

#### --drive-pacer-min-sleep

Minimum time to sleep between API calls.

- Config:      pacer_min_sleep
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_MIN_SLEEP
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     100ms

#### --drive-pacer-burst

Number of API calls to allow without sleeping.

- Config:      pacer_burst
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_PACER_BURST
- Type:        int
- Default:     100

#### --drive-server-side-across-configs

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different drive configs.

This can be useful if you wish to do a server-side copy between two
different Google drives.  Note that this isn't enabled by default
because it isn't easy to tell if it will work between any two
configurations.

- Config:      server_side_across_configs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-disable-http2

Disable drive using http2.

There is currently an unsolved issue with the google drive backend and
HTTP/2.  HTTP/2 is therefore disabled by default for the drive backend
but can be re-enabled here.  When the issue is solved this flag will
be removed.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3631



- Config:      disable_http2
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_DISABLE_HTTP2
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --drive-stop-on-upload-limit

Make upload limit errors be fatal.

At the time of writing it is only possible to upload 750 GiB of data to
Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is
reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When
this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal.  These will stop
the in-progress sync.

Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which
Google don't document so it may break in the future.

See: https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/3857


- Config:      stop_on_upload_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_STOP_ON_UPLOAD_LIMIT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-stop-on-download-limit

Make download limit errors be fatal.

At the time of writing it is only possible to download 10 TiB of data from
Google Drive a day (this is an undocumented limit). When this limit is
reached Google Drive produces a slightly different error message. When
this flag is set it causes these errors to be fatal.  These will stop
the in-progress sync.

Note that this detection is relying on error message strings which
Google don't document so it may break in the future.


- Config:      stop_on_download_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_STOP_ON_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-skip-shortcuts

If set skip shortcut files.

Normally rclone dereferences shortcut files making them appear as if
they are the original file (see [the shortcuts section](#shortcuts)).
If this flag is set then rclone will ignore shortcut files completely.


- Config:      skip_shortcuts
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_SKIP_SHORTCUTS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --drive-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_DRIVE_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     InvalidUtf8

## Backend commands

Here are the commands specific to the drive backend.

Run them with

    rclone backend COMMAND remote:

The help below will explain what arguments each command takes.

See [the "rclone backend" command](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_backend/) for more
info on how to pass options and arguments.

These can be run on a running backend using the rc command
[backend/command](https://rclone.org/rc/#backend/command).

### get

Get command for fetching the drive config parameters

    rclone backend get remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a get command which will be used to fetch the various drive config parameters

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend get drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]
    rclone rc backend/command command=get fs=drive: [-o service_account_file] [-o chunk_size]


Options:

- "chunk_size": show the current upload chunk size
- "service_account_file": show the current service account file

### set

Set command for updating the drive config parameters

    rclone backend set remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This is a set command which will be used to update the various drive config parameters

Usage Examples:

    rclone backend set drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]
    rclone rc backend/command command=set fs=drive: [-o service_account_file=sa.json] [-o chunk_size=67108864]


Options:

- "chunk_size": update the current upload chunk size
- "service_account_file": update the current service account file

### shortcut

Create shortcuts from files or directories

    rclone backend shortcut remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command creates shortcuts from files or directories.

Usage:

    rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item destination_shortcut
    rclone backend shortcut drive: source_item -o target=drive2: destination_shortcut

In the first example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item"
which can be a file or a directory to the "destination_shortcut". The
"source_item" and the "destination_shortcut" should be relative paths
from "drive:"

In the second example this creates a shortcut from the "source_item"
relative to "drive:" to the "destination_shortcut" relative to
"drive2:". This may fail with a permission error if the user
authenticated with "drive2:" can't read files from "drive:".


Options:

- "target": optional target remote for the shortcut destination

### drives

List the Shared Drives available to this account

    rclone backend drives remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command lists the Shared Drives (Team Drives) available to this
account.

Usage:

    rclone backend [-o config] drives drive:

This will return a JSON list of objects like this

    [
        {
            "id": "0ABCDEF-01234567890",
            "kind": "drive#teamDrive",
            "name": "My Drive"
        },
        {
            "id": "0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl",
            "kind": "drive#teamDrive",
            "name": "Test Drive"
        }
    ]

With the -o config parameter it will output the list in a format
suitable for adding to a config file to make aliases for all the
drives found.

    [My Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEF-01234567890,root_folder_id=:

    [Test Drive]
    type = alias
    remote = drive,team_drive=0ABCDEFabcdefghijkl,root_folder_id=:

Adding this to the rclone config file will cause those team drives to
be accessible with the aliases shown. This may require manual editing
of the names.



### untrash

Untrash files and directories

    rclone backend untrash remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command untrashes all the files and directories in the directory
passed in recursively.

Usage:

This takes an optional directory to trash which make this easier to
use via the API.

    rclone backend untrash drive:directory
    rclone backend -i untrash drive:directory subdir

Use the -i flag to see what would be restored before restoring it.

Result:

    {
        "Untrashed": 17,
        "Errors": 0
    }


### copyid

Copy files by ID

    rclone backend copyid remote: [options] [<arguments>+]

This command copies files by ID

Usage:

    rclone backend copyid drive: ID path
    rclone backend copyid drive: ID1 path1 ID2 path2

It copies the drive file with ID given to the path (an rclone path which
will be passed internally to rclone copyto). The ID and path pairs can be
repeated.

The path should end with a / to indicate copy the file as named to
this directory. If it doesn't end with a / then the last path
component will be used as the file name.

If the destination is a drive backend then server-side copying will be
attempted if possible.

Use the -i flag to see what would be copied before copying.




## Limitations

Drive has quite a lot of rate limiting.  This causes rclone to be
limited to transferring about 2 files per second only.  Individual
files may be transferred much faster at 100s of MiB/s but lots of
small files can take a long time.

Server side copies are also subject to a separate rate limit. If you
see User rate limit exceeded errors, wait at least 24 hours and retry.
You can disable server-side copies with `--disable copy` to download
and upload the files if you prefer.

### Limitations of Google Docs

Google docs will appear as size -1 in `rclone ls` and as size 0 in
anything which uses the VFS layer, e.g. `rclone mount`, `rclone serve`.

This is because rclone can't find out the size of the Google docs
without downloading them.

Google docs will transfer correctly with `rclone sync`, `rclone copy`
etc as rclone knows to ignore the size when doing the transfer.

However an unfortunate consequence of this is that you may not be able
to download Google docs using `rclone mount`. If it doesn't work you
will get a 0 sized file.  If you try again the doc may gain its
correct size and be downloadable. Whether it will work on not depends
on the application accessing the mount and the OS you are running -
experiment to find out if it does work for you!

### Duplicated files

Sometimes, for no reason I've been able to track down, drive will
duplicate a file that rclone uploads.  Drive unlike all the other
remotes can have duplicated files.

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use `rclone dedupe` to fix duplicated files.

Note that this isn't just a problem with rclone, even Google Photos on
Android duplicates files on drive sometimes.

### Rclone appears to be re-copying files it shouldn't

The most likely cause of this is the duplicated file issue above - run
`rclone dedupe` and check your logs for duplicate object or directory
messages.

This can also be caused by a delay/caching on google drive's end when
comparing directory listings. Specifically with team drives used in
combination with --fast-list. Files that were uploaded recently may
not appear on the directory list sent to rclone when using --fast-list.

Waiting a moderate period of time between attempts (estimated to be
approximately 1 hour) and/or not using --fast-list both seem to be
effective in preventing the problem.

## Making your own client_id

When you use rclone with Google drive in its default configuration you
are using rclone's client_id.  This is shared between all the rclone
users.  There is a global rate limit on the number of queries per
second that each client_id can do set by Google.  rclone already has a
high quota and I will continue to make sure it is high enough by
contacting Google.

It is strongly recommended to use your own client ID as the default rclone ID is heavily used. If you have multiple services running, it is recommended to use an API key for each service. The default Google quota is 10 transactions per second so it is recommended to stay under that number as if you use more than that, it will cause rclone to rate limit and make things slower.

Here is how to create your own Google Drive client ID for rclone:

1. Log into the [Google API
Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) with your Google
account. It doesn't matter what Google account you use. (It need not
be the same account as the Google Drive you want to access)

2. Select a project or create a new project.

3. Under "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" search for "Drive", and enable the
"Google Drive API".

4. Click "Credentials" in the left-side panel (not "Create
credentials", which opens the wizard), then "Create credentials"

5. If you already configured an "Oauth Consent Screen", then skip
to the next step; if not, click on "CONFIGURE CONSENT SCREEN" button 
(near the top right corner of the right panel), then select "External"
and click on "CREATE"; on the next screen, enter an "Application name"
("rclone" is OK) then click on "Save" (all other data is optional). 
Click again on "Credentials" on the left panel to go back to the 
"Credentials" screen.

(PS: if you are a GSuite user, you could also select "Internal" instead
of "External" above, but this has not been tested/documented so far). 

6.  Click on the "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button at the top of the screen,
then select "OAuth client ID".

7. Choose an application type of "Desktop app" and click "Create". (the default name is fine)

8. It will show you a client ID and client secret. Make a note of these.

9. Go to "Oauth consent screen" and press "Publish App"

10. Provide the noted client ID and client secret to rclone.

11. Click "OAuth consent screen", then click "PUBLISH APP" button and 
confirm, or add your account under "Test users".

Be aware that, due to the "enhanced security" recently introduced by
Google, you are theoretically expected to "submit your app for verification"
and then wait a few weeks(!) for their response; in practice, you can go right
ahead and use the client ID and client secret with rclone, the only issue will
be a very scary confirmation screen shown when you connect via your browser 
for rclone to be able to get its token-id (but as this only happens during 
the remote configuration, it's not such a big deal). 

(Thanks to @balazer on github for these instructions.)

Sometimes, creation of an OAuth consent in Google API Console fails due to an error message
“The request failed because changes to one of the field of the resource is not supported”.
As a convenient workaround, the necessary Google Drive API key can be created on the
[Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python) page.
Just push the Enable the Drive API button to receive the Client ID and Secret.
Note that it will automatically create a new project in the API Console.

#  Google Photos

The rclone backend for [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/photos/about/) is
a specialized backend for transferring photos and videos to and from
Google Photos.

**NB** The Google Photos API which rclone uses has quite a few
limitations, so please read the [limitations section](#limitations)
carefully to make sure it is suitable for your use.

## Configuration

The initial setup for google cloud storage involves getting a token from Google Photos
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Google Photos
   \ "google photos"
[snip]
Storage> google photos
** See help for google photos backend at: https://rclone.org/googlephotos/ **

Google Application Client Id
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_id> 
Google Application Client Secret
Leave blank normally.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
client_secret> 
Set to make the Google Photos backend read only.

If you choose read only then rclone will only request read only access
to your photos, otherwise rclone will request full access.
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
read_only> 
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code

*** IMPORTANT: All media items uploaded to Google Photos with rclone
*** are stored in full resolution at original quality.  These uploads
*** will count towards storage in your Google Account.

--------------------
[remote]
type = google photos
token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"Bearer","refresh_token":"XXX","expiry":"2019-06-28T17:38:04.644930156+01:00"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This only
runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host
firewall, or use manual mode.

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the albums in your photos

    rclone lsd remote:album

Make a new album

    rclone mkdir remote:album/newAlbum

List the contents of an album

    rclone ls remote:album/newAlbum

Sync `/home/local/images` to the Google Photos, removing any excess
files in the album.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/image remote:album/newAlbum

### Layout

As Google Photos is not a general purpose cloud storage system the
backend is laid out to help you navigate it.

The directories under `media` show different ways of categorizing the
media.  Each file will appear multiple times.  So if you want to make
a backup of your google photos you might choose to backup
`remote:media/by-month`.  (**NB** `remote:media/by-day` is rather slow
at the moment so avoid for syncing.)

Note that all your photos and videos will appear somewhere under
`media`, but they may not appear under `album` unless you've put them
into albums.

```
/
- upload
    - file1.jpg
    - file2.jpg
    - ...

                - file1.jpg
                - ...
            - 2000-01-02
                - file2.jpg
                - ...
        - ...
- album
    - album name
    - album name/sub

    - album name
    - album name/sub

        - file1.jpg
        - file2.jpg
```

There are two writable parts of the tree, the `upload` directory and
sub directories of the `album` directory.

The `upload` directory is for uploading files you don't want to put
into albums. This will be empty to start with and will contain the
files you've uploaded for one rclone session only, becoming empty
again when you restart rclone. The use case for this would be if you
have a load of files you just want to once off dump into Google
Photos. For repeated syncing, uploading to `album` will work better.

Directories within the `album` directory are also writeable and you
may create new directories (albums) under `album`.  If you copy files
with a directory hierarchy in there then rclone will create albums
with the `/` character in them.  For example if you do

    rclone copy /path/to/images remote:album/images

and the images directory contains

```
images
    - file1.jpg
    dir
        file2.jpg
    dir2
        dir3
            file3.jpg
```

Then rclone will create the following albums with the following files in

- images
    - file1.jpg
- images/dir
    - file2.jpg
- images/dir2/dir3
    - file3.jpg

This means that you can use the `album` path pretty much like a normal
filesystem and it is a good target for repeated syncing.

The `shared-album` directory shows albums shared with you or by you.
This is similar to the Sharing tab in the Google Photos web interface.

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --gphotos-read-size

Set to read the size of media items.

Normally rclone does not read the size of media items since this takes
another transaction.  This isn't necessary for syncing.  However
rclone mount needs to know the size of files in advance of reading
them, so setting this flag when using rclone mount is recommended if
you want to read the media.

- Config:      read_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_READ_SIZE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gphotos-start-year

Year limits the photos to be downloaded to those which are uploaded after the given year.

- Config:      start_year
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_START_YEAR
- Type:        int
- Default:     2000

#### --gphotos-include-archived

Also view and download archived media.

By default rclone does not request archived media. Thus, when syncing,
archived media is not visible in directory listings or transferred.

Note that media in albums is always visible and synced, no matter
their archive status.

With this flag, archived media are always visible in directory
listings and transferred.

Without this flag, archived media will not be visible in directory
listings and won't be transferred.

- Config:      include_archived
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_INCLUDE_ARCHIVED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --gphotos-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_GPHOTOS_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,CrLf,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Only images and videos can be uploaded.  If you attempt to upload non
videos or images or formats that Google Photos doesn't understand,
rclone will upload the file, then Google Photos will give an error
when it is put turned into a media item.

Note that all media items uploaded to Google Photos through the API
are stored in full resolution at "original quality" and **will** count
towards your storage quota in your Google Account.  The API does
**not** offer a way to upload in "high quality" mode..

`rclone about` is not supported by the Google Photos backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

### Downloading Images

When Images are downloaded this strips EXIF location (according to the
docs and my tests).  This is a limitation of the Google Photos API and
is covered by [bug #112096115](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/112096115).

**The current google API does not allow photos to be downloaded at original resolution.  This is very important if you are, for example, relying on "Google Photos" as a backup of your photos.  You will not be able to use rclone to redownload original images.  You could use 'google takeout' to recover the original photos as a last resort**

### Downloading Videos

When videos are downloaded they are downloaded in a really compressed
version of the video compared to downloading it via the Google Photos
web interface. This is covered by [bug #113672044](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/113672044).

### Duplicates

If a file name is duplicated in a directory then rclone will add the
file ID into its name.  So two files called `file.jpg` would then
appear as `file {123456}.jpg` and `file {ABCDEF}.jpg` (the actual IDs
are a lot longer alas!).

If you upload the same image (with the same binary data) twice then
Google Photos will deduplicate it.  However it will retain the
filename from the first upload which may confuse rclone.  For example
if you uploaded an image to `upload` then uploaded the same image to
`album/my_album` the filename of the image in `album/my_album` will be
what it was uploaded with initially, not what you uploaded it with to
`album`.  In practise this shouldn't cause too many problems.

### Modified time

The date shown of media in Google Photos is the creation date as
determined by the EXIF information, or the upload date if that is not
known.

This is not changeable by rclone and is not the modification date of
the media on local disk.  This means that rclone cannot use the dates
from Google Photos for syncing purposes.

### Size

The Google Photos API does not return the size of media.  This means
that when syncing to Google Photos, rclone can only do a file
existence check.

It is possible to read the size of the media, but this needs an extra
HTTP HEAD request per media item so is **very slow** and uses up a lot of
transactions.  This can be enabled with the `--gphotos-read-size`
option or the `read_size = true` config parameter.

If you want to use the backend with `rclone mount` you may need to
enable this flag (depending on your OS and application using the
photos) otherwise you may not be able to read media off the mount.
You'll need to experiment to see if it works for you without the flag.

### Albums

Rclone can only upload files to albums it created. This is a
[limitation of the Google Photos API](https://developers.google.com/photos/library/guides/manage-albums).

Rclone can remove files it uploaded from albums it created only.

### Deleting files

Rclone can remove files from albums it created, but note that the
Google Photos API does not allow media to be deleted permanently so
this media will still remain. See [bug #109759781](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109759781).

Rclone cannot delete files anywhere except under `album`.

### Deleting albums

The Google Photos API does not support deleting albums - see [bug #135714733](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/135714733).

#  Hasher (EXPERIMENTAL)

Hasher is a special overlay backend to create remotes which handle
checksums for other remotes. It's main functions include:
- Emulate hash types unimplemented by backends
- Cache checksums to help with slow hashing of large local or (S)FTP files
- Warm up checksum cache from external SUM files

## Getting started

To use Hasher, first set up the underlying remote following the configuration
instructions for that remote. You can also use a local pathname instead of
a remote. Check that your base remote is working.

Let's call the base remote `myRemote:path` here. Note that anything inside
`myRemote:path` will be handled by hasher and anything outside won't.
This means that if you are using a bucket based remote (S3, B2, Swift)
then you should put the bucket in the remote `s3:bucket`.

Now proceed to interactive or manual configuration.

### Interactive configuration

Run `rclone config`:
```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> Hasher1
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Handle checksums for other remotes
   \ "hasher"
[snip]
Storage> hasher
Remote to cache checksums for, like myremote:mypath.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
remote> myRemote:path
Comma separated list of supported checksum types.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("md5,sha1").
hashsums> md5
Maximum time to keep checksums in cache. 0 = no cache, off = cache forever.
max_age> off
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
--------------------
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashsums = md5
max_age = off
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

### Manual configuration

Run `rclone config path` to see the path of current active config file,
usually `YOURHOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`.
Open it in your favorite text editor, find section for the base remote
and create new section for hasher like in the following examples:

```
[Hasher1]
type = hasher
remote = myRemote:path
hashes = md5
max_age = off

[Hasher2]
type = hasher
remote = /local/path
hashes = dropbox,sha1
max_age = 24h
```

Hasher takes basically the following parameters:
- `remote` is required,
- `hashes` is a comma separated list of supported checksums
   (by default `md5,sha1`),
- `max_age` - maximum time to keep a checksum value in the cache,
   `0` will disable caching completely,
   `off` will cache "forever" (that is until the files get changed).

Make sure the `remote` has `:` (colon) in. If you specify the remote without
a colon then rclone will use a local directory of that name. So if you use
a remote of `/local/path` then rclone will handle hashes for that directory.
If you use `remote = name` literally then rclone will put files
**in a directory called `name` located under current directory**.

## Usage

### Basic operations

Now you can use it as `Hasher2:subdir/file` instead of base remote.
Hasher will transparently update cache with new checksums when a file
is fully read or overwritten, like:
```
rclone copy External:path/file Hasher:dest/path

rclone cat Hasher:path/to/file > /dev/null
```

The way to refresh **all** cached checksums (even unsupported by the base backend)
for a subtree is to **re-download** all files in the subtree. For example,
use `hashsum --download` using **any** supported hashsum on the command line
(we just care to re-read):
```
rclone hashsum MD5 --download Hasher:path/to/subtree > /dev/null

rclone backend dump Hasher:path/to/subtree
```

You can print or drop hashsum cache using custom backend commands:
```
rclone backend dump Hasher:dir/subdir

rclone backend drop Hasher:
```

### Pre-Seed from a SUM File

Hasher supports two backend commands: generic SUM file `import` and faster
but less consistent `stickyimport`.

```
rclone backend import Hasher:dir/subdir SHA1 /path/to/SHA1SUM [--checkers 4]
```

Instead of SHA1 it can be any hash supported by the remote. The last argument
can point to either a local or an `other-remote:path` text file in SUM format.
The command will parse the SUM file, then walk down the path given by the
first argument, snapshot current fingerprints and fill in the cache entries
correspondingly.
- Paths in the SUM file are treated as relative to `hasher:dir/subdir`.
- The command will **not** check that supplied values are correct.
  You **must know** what you are doing.
- This is a one-time action. The SUM file will not get "attached" to the
  remote. Cache entries can still be overwritten later, should the object's
  fingerprint change.
- The tree walk can take long depending on the tree size. You can increase
  `--checkers` to make it faster. Or use `stickyimport` if you don't care
  about fingerprints and consistency.

```
rclone backend stickyimport hasher:path/to/data sha1 remote:/path/to/sum.sha1
```

`stickyimport` is similar to `import` but works much faster because it
does not need to stat existing files and skips initial tree walk.
Instead of binding cache entries to file fingerprints it creates _sticky_
entries bound to the file name alone ignoring size, modification time etc.
Such hash entries can be replaced only by `purge`, `delete`, `backend drop`
or by full re-read/re-write of the files.

## Implementation details (advanced)

This section explains how various rclone operations work on a hasher remote.

**Disclaimer. This section describes current implementation which can
change in future rclone versions!.**

### Hashsum command

The `rclone hashsum` (or `md5sum` or `sha1sum`) command will:

1. if requested hash is supported by lower level, just pass it.
2. if object size is below `auto_size` then download object and calculate
   _requested_ hashes on the fly.
3. if unsupported and the size is big enough, build object `fingerprint`
   (including size, modtime if supported, first-found _other_ hash if any).
4. if the strict match is found in cache for the requested remote, return
   the stored hash.
5. if remote found but fingerprint mismatched, then purge the entry and
   proceed to step 6.
6. if remote not found or had no requested hash type or after step 5:
   download object, calculate all _supported_ hashes on the fly and store
   in cache; return requested hash.

### Other operations

- whenever a file is uploaded or downloaded **in full**, capture the stream
  to calculate all supported hashes on the fly and update database
- server-side `move`  will update keys of existing cache entries
- `deletefile` will remove a single cache entry
- `purge` will remove all cache entries under the purged path

Note that setting `max_age = 0` will disable checksum caching completely.

If you set `max_age = off`, checksums in cache will never age, unless you
fully rewrite or delete the file.

### Cache storage

Cached checksums are stored as `bolt` database files under rclone cache
directory, usually `~/.cache/rclone/kv/`. Databases are maintained
one per _base_ backend, named like `BaseRemote~hasher.bolt`.
Checksums for multiple `alias`-es into a single base backend
will be stored in the single database. All local paths are treated as
aliases into the `local` backend (unless crypted or chunked) and stored
in `~/.cache/rclone/kv/local~hasher.bolt`.
Databases can be shared between multiple rclone processes.

#  HDFS

[HDFS](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html) is a
distributed file-system, part of the [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) framework.

Paths are specified as `remote:` or `remote:path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`. First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[skip]

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type

hadoop               hdfs

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote `directory` to `/home/local/directory`, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync -i remote:directory /home/local/directory

### Setting up your own HDFS instance for testing

You may start with a [manual setup](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)
or use the docker image from the tests:

If you want to build the docker image

```
git clone https://github.com/rclone/rclone.git
cd rclone/fstest/testserver/images/test-hdfs
docker build --rm -t rclone/test-hdfs .
```

Or you can just use the latest one pushed

```
docker run --rm --name "rclone-hdfs" -p 127.0.0.1:9866:9866 -p 127.0.0.1:8020:8020 --hostname "rclone-hdfs" rclone/test-hdfs
```

**NB** it need few seconds to startup.

For this docker image the remote needs to be configured like this:

```
[remote]
type = hdfs
namenode = 127.0.0.1:8020
username = root
```

You can stop this image with `docker kill rclone-hdfs` (**NB** it does not use volumes, so all data
uploaded will be lost.)

### Modified time

Time accurate to 1 second is stored.

### Checksum

No checksums are implemented.

### Usage information

You can use the `rclone about remote:` command which will display filesystem size and current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| :         | 0x3A  | ：           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8).


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to hdfs (Hadoop distributed file system).

#### --hdfs-namenode

Hadoop name node and port.

E.g. "namenode:8020" to connect to host namenode at port 8020.

- Config:      namenode
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HDFS_NAMENODE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --hdfs-username

Hadoop user name.

- Config:      username
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HDFS_USERNAME
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "root"
        - Connect to hdfs as root.

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to hdfs (Hadoop distributed file system).

#### --hdfs-service-principal-name

Kerberos service principal name for the namenode.

Enables KERBEROS authentication. Specifies the Service Principal Name
(SERVICE/FQDN) for the namenode. E.g. \"hdfs/namenode.hadoop.docker\"
for namenode running as service 'hdfs' with FQDN 'namenode.hadoop.docker'.

- Config:      service_principal_name
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HDFS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --hdfs-data-transfer-protection

Kerberos data transfer protection: authentication|integrity|privacy.

Specifies whether or not authentication, data signature integrity
checks, and wire encryption is required when communicating the the
datanodes. Possible values are 'authentication', 'integrity' and
'privacy'. Used only with KERBEROS enabled.

- Config:      data_transfer_protection
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HDFS_DATA_TRANSFER_PROTECTION
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "privacy"
        - Ensure authentication, integrity and encryption enabled.

#### --hdfs-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HDFS_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,Colon,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

- No server-side `Move` or `DirMove`.
- Checksums not implemented.

#  HTTP

The HTTP remote is a read only remote for reading files of a
webserver.  The webserver should provide file listings which rclone
will read and turn into a remote.  This has been tested with common
webservers such as Apache/Nginx/Caddy and will likely work with file
listings from most web servers.  (If it doesn't then please file an
issue, or send a pull request!)

Paths are specified as `remote:` or `remote:path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First
run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all the top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync the remote `directory` to `/home/local/directory`, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync -i remote:directory /home/local/directory

### Read only ###

This remote is read only - you can't upload files to an HTTP server.

### Modified time ###

Most HTTP servers store time accurate to 1 second.

### Checksum ###

No checksums are stored.

### Usage without a config file ###

Since the http remote only has one config parameter it is easy to use
without a config file:

    rclone lsd --http-url https://beta.rclone.org :http:


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to http (http Connection).

#### --http-url

URL of http host to connect to.

E.g. "https://example.com", or "https://user:pass@example.com" to use a username and password.

- Config:      url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to http (http Connection).

#### --http-headers

Set HTTP headers for all transactions.

Use this to set additional HTTP headers for all transactions.

The input format is comma separated list of key,value pairs.  Standard
[CSV encoding](https://godoc.org/encoding/csv) may be used.

For example to set a Cookie use 'Cookie,name=value', or '"Cookie","name=value"'.

You can set multiple headers, e.g. '"Cookie","name=value","Authorization","xxx"'.


- Config:      headers
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_HEADERS
- Type:        CommaSepList
- Default:     

#### --http-no-slash

Set this if the site doesn't end directories with /.

Use this if your target website does not use / on the end of
directories.

A / on the end of a path is how rclone normally tells the difference
between files and directories.  If this flag is set, then rclone will
treat all files with Content-Type: text/html as directories and read
URLs from them rather than downloading them.

Note that this may cause rclone to confuse genuine HTML files with
directories.

- Config:      no_slash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_SLASH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --http-no-head

Don't use HEAD requests to find file sizes in dir listing.

If your site is being very slow to load then you can try this option.
Normally rclone does a HEAD request for each potential file in a
directory listing to:

- find its size
- check it really exists
- check to see if it is a directory

If you set this option, rclone will not do the HEAD request.  This will mean

- directory listings are much quicker
- rclone won't have the times or sizes of any files
- some files that don't exist may be in the listing


- Config:      no_head
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HTTP_NO_HEAD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false



## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the HTTP backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  Hubic

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:container/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for Hubic involves getting a token from Hubic which
you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
n/s> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Hubic
   \ "hubic"
[snip]
Storage> hubic
Hubic Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id>
Hubic Client Secret - leave blank normally.
client_secret>
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
client_id =
client_secret =
token = {"access_token":"XXXXXX"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Hubic. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List containers in the top level of your Hubic

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Hubic

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Hubic directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

If you want the directory to be visible in the official *Hubic
browser*, you need to copy your files to the `default` directory

    rclone copy /home/source remote:default/backup

### --fast-list ###

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Modified time ###

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Object-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1
ns.

This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

Note that Hubic wraps the Swift backend, so most of the properties of
are the same.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to hubic (Hubic).

#### --hubic-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --hubic-client-secret

OAuth Client Secret.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      client_secret
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_CLIENT_SECRET
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to hubic (Hubic).

#### --hubic-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

- Config:      token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --hubic-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --hubic-token-url

Token server url.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --hubic-chunk-size

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.  The
default for this is 5 GiB which is its maximum value.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Gi

#### --hubic-no-chunk

Don't chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (e.g. using rcat or mount) setting this
flag will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum upload size to 5 GiB. However non chunked
files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

- Config:      no_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_NO_CHUNK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --hubic-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_HUBIC_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8



## Limitations

This uses the normal OpenStack Swift mechanism to refresh the Swift
API credentials and ignores the expires field returned by the Hubic
API.

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

#  Jottacloud

Jottacloud is a cloud storage service provider from a Norwegian company, using its own datacenters
in Norway. In addition to the official service at [jottacloud.com](https://www.jottacloud.com/),
it also provides white-label solutions to different companies, such as:
* Telia
  * Telia Cloud (cloud.telia.se)
  * Telia Sky (sky.telia.no)
* Tele2
  * Tele2 Cloud (mittcloud.tele2.se)
* Elkjøp (with subsidiaries):
  * Elkjøp Cloud (cloud.elkjop.no)
  * Elgiganten Sweden (cloud.elgiganten.se)
  * Elgiganten Denmark (cloud.elgiganten.dk)
  * Giganti Cloud  (cloud.gigantti.fi)
  * ELKO Clouud (cloud.elko.is)

Most of the white-label versions are supported by this backend, although may require different
authentication setup - described below.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Authentication types

Some of the whitelabel versions uses a different authentication method than the official service,
and you have to choose the correct one when setting up the remote.

### Standard authentication

To configure Jottacloud you will need to generate a personal security token in the Jottacloud web interface.
You will the option to do in your [account security settings](https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure)
(for whitelabel version you need to find this page in its web interface).
Note that the web interface may refer to this token as a JottaCli token.

### Legacy authentication

If you are using one of the whitelabel versions (e.g. from Elkjøp or Tele2) you may not have the option
to generate a CLI token. In this case you'll have to use the legacy authentication. To to this select
yes when the setup asks for legacy authentication and enter your username and password.
The rest of the setup is identical to the default setup.

### Telia Cloud authentication

Similar to other whitelabel versions Telia Cloud doesn't offer the option of creating a CLI token, and
additionally uses a separate authentication flow where the username is generated internally. To setup
rclone to use Telia Cloud, choose Telia Cloud authentication in the setup. The rest of the setup is
identical to the default setup.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote` with the default setup.  First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Jottacloud
   \ "jottacloud"
[snip]
Storage> jottacloud
** See help for jottacloud backend at: https://rclone.org/jottacloud/ **

Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> n
Remote config
Use legacy authentication?.
This is only required for certain whitelabel versions of Jottacloud and not recommended for normal users.
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n

Generate a personal login token here: https://www.jottacloud.com/web/secure
Login Token> <your token here>

Do you want to use a non standard device/mountpoint e.g. for accessing files uploaded using the official Jottacloud client?

y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
Please select the device to use. Normally this will be Jotta
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
 1 > DESKTOP-3H31129
 2 > Jotta
Devices> 2
Please select the mountpoint to user. Normally this will be Archive
Choose a number from below, or type in an existing value
 1 > Archive
 2 > Links
 3 > Sync
 
Mountpoints> 1
--------------------
[jotta]
type = jottacloud
token = {........}
device = Jotta
mountpoint = Archive
configVersion = 1
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```
Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Jottacloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Jottacloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Jottacloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Devices and Mountpoints

The official Jottacloud client registers a device for each computer you install it on,
and then creates a mountpoint for each folder you select for Backup.
The web interface uses a special device called Jotta for the Archive and Sync mountpoints.
In most cases you'll want to use the Jotta/Archive device/mountpoint, however if you want to access
files uploaded by any of the official clients rclone provides the option to select other devices
and mountpoints during config.

The built-in Jotta device may also contain several other mountpoints, such as: Latest, Links, Shared and Trash.
These are special mountpoints with a different internal representation than the "regular" mountpoints.
Rclone will only to a very limited degree support them. Generally you should avoid these, unless you know what you
are doing.

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

Note that the implementation in Jottacloud always uses only a single
API request to get the entire list, so for large folders this could
lead to long wait time before the first results are shown.

### Modified time and hashes

Jottacloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

Jottacloud supports MD5 type hashes, so you can use the `--checksum`
flag.

Note that Jottacloud requires the MD5 hash before upload so if the
source does not have an MD5 checksum then the file will be cached
temporarily on disk (wherever the `TMPDIR` environment variable points
to) before it is uploaded. Small files will be cached in memory - see
the [--jottacloud-md5-memory-limit](#jottacloud-md5-memory-limit) flag.
When uploading from local disk the source checksum is always available,
so this does not apply. Starting with rclone version 1.52 the same is
true for crypted remotes (in older versions the crypt backend would not
calculate hashes for uploads from local disk, so the Jottacloud
backend had to do it as described above).

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.

### Deleting files

By default rclone will send all files to the trash when deleting files. They will be permanently
deleted automatically after 30 days. You may bypass the trash and permanently delete files immediately
by using the [--jottacloud-hard-delete](#jottacloud-hard-delete) flag, or set the equivalent environment variable.
Emptying the trash is supported by the [cleanup](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_cleanup/) command.

### Versions

Jottacloud supports file versioning. When rclone uploads a new version of a file it creates a new version of it.
Currently rclone only supports retrieving the current version but older versions can be accessed via the Jottacloud Website.

Versioning can be disabled by `--jottacloud-no-versions` option. This is achieved by deleting the remote file prior to uploading
a new version. If the upload the fails no version of the file will be available in the remote.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (unless it is unlimited)
and the current usage.


### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to jottacloud (Jottacloud).

#### --jottacloud-md5-memory-limit

Files bigger than this will be cached on disk to calculate the MD5 if required.

- Config:      md5_memory_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_MD5_MEMORY_LIMIT
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Mi

#### --jottacloud-trashed-only

Only show files that are in the trash.

This will show trashed files in their original directory structure.

- Config:      trashed_only
- Env Var:     RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_TRASHED_ONLY
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --jottacloud-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

- Config:      hard_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_HARD_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --jottacloud-upload-resume-limit

Files bigger than this can be resumed if the upload fail's.

- Config:      upload_resume_limit
- Env Var:     RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_UPLOAD_RESUME_LIMIT
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Mi

#### --jottacloud-no-versions

Avoid server side versioning by deleting files and recreating files instead of overwriting them.

- Config:      no_versions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_NO_VERSIONS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --jottacloud-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_JOTTACLOUD_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Note that Jottacloud is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in Jottacloud file names. Rclone will map these names to and from an identical
looking unicode equivalent. For example if a file has a ? in it will be mapped to ？ instead.

Jottacloud only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

## Troubleshooting

Jottacloud exhibits some inconsistent behaviours regarding deleted files and folders which may cause Copy, Move and DirMove
operations to previously deleted paths to fail. Emptying the trash should help in such cases.

#  Koofr

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for Koofr involves creating an application password for
rclone. You can do that by opening the Koofr
[web application](https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password),
giving the password a nice name like `rclone` and clicking on generate.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `koofr`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> koofr 
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value

** See help for koofr backend at: https://rclone.org/koofr/ **

Your Koofr user name
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
user> USER@NAME
Your Koofr password for rclone (generate one at https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password)
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
y/g> y
Enter the password:

baseurl = https://app.koofr.net
user = USER@NAME
password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

You can choose to edit advanced config in order to enter your own service URL
if you use an on-premise or white label Koofr instance, or choose an alternative
mount instead of your primary storage.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Koofr

    rclone lsd koofr:

List all the files in your Koofr

    rclone ls koofr:

To copy a local directory to an Koofr directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to koofr (Koofr).

#### --koofr-user

Your Koofr user name.

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_KOOFR_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --koofr-password

Your Koofr password for rclone (generate one at https://app.koofr.net/app/admin/preferences/password).

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_KOOFR_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to koofr (Koofr).

#### --koofr-endpoint

The Koofr API endpoint to use.

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_KOOFR_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Default:     "https://app.koofr.net"

#### --koofr-mountid

Mount ID of the mount to use.

If omitted, the primary mount is used.

- Config:      mountid
- Env Var:     RCLONE_KOOFR_MOUNTID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --koofr-setmtime

Does the backend support setting modification time.

Set this to false if you use a mount ID that points to a Dropbox or Amazon Drive backend.

- Config:      setmtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_KOOFR_SETMTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --koofr-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_KOOFR_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Note that Koofr is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

#  Mail.ru Cloud

[Mail.ru Cloud](https://cloud.mail.ru/) is a cloud storage provided by a Russian internet company [Mail.Ru Group](https://mail.ru). The official desktop client is [Disk-O:](https://disk-o.cloud/en), available on Windows and Mac OS.

Currently it is recommended to disable 2FA on Mail.ru accounts intended for rclone until it gets eventually implemented.

## Features highlights

- Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`
- Files have a `last modified time` property, directories don't
- Deleted files are by default moved to the trash
- Files and directories can be shared via public links
- Partial uploads or streaming are not supported, file size must be known before upload
- Maximum file size is limited to 2G for a free account, unlimited for paid accounts
- Storage keeps hash for all files and performs transparent deduplication,
  the hash algorithm is a modified SHA1
- If a particular file is already present in storage, one can quickly submit file hash
  instead of long file upload (this optimization is supported by rclone)

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a mailru configuration. First create a Mail.ru Cloud
account and choose a tariff, then run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Enable
   \ "true"
 2 / Disable
   \ "false"

Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No

Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
type = mailru
user = username@mail.ru
pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
speedup_enable = true
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Configuration of this backend does not require a local web browser.
You can use the configured backend as shown below:

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

### Modified time

Files support a modification time attribute with up to 1 second precision.
Directories do not have a modification time, which is shown as "Jan 1 1970".

### Hash checksums

Hash sums use a custom Mail.ru algorithm based on SHA1.
If file size is less than or equal to the SHA1 block size (20 bytes),
its hash is simply its data right-padded with zero bytes.
Hash sum of a larger file is computed as a SHA1 sum of the file data
bytes concatenated with a decimal representation of the data length.

### Emptying Trash

Removing a file or directory actually moves it to the trash, which is not
visible to rclone but can be seen in a web browser. The trashed file
still occupies part of total quota. If you wish to empty your trash
and free some quota, you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:` command,
which will permanently delete all your trashed files.
This command does not take any path arguments.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

#### --mailru-user

User name (usually email).

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --mailru-pass

Password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_PASS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --mailru-speedup-enable

Skip full upload if there is another file with same data hash.

This feature is called "speedup" or "put by hash". It is especially efficient
in case of generally available files like popular books, video or audio clips,
because files are searched by hash in all accounts of all mailru users.
It is meaningless and ineffective if source file is unique or encrypted.
Please note that rclone may need local memory and disk space to calculate
content hash in advance and decide whether full upload is required.
Also, if rclone does not know file size in advance (e.g. in case of
streaming or partial uploads), it will not even try this optimization.

- Config:      speedup_enable

    - "false"
        - Disable

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to mailru (Mail.ru Cloud).

#### --mailru-speedup-file-patterns

Comma separated list of file name patterns eligible for speedup (put by hash).

Patterns are case insensitive and can contain '*' or '?' meta characters.

- Config:      speedup_file_patterns
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_FILE_PATTERNS

    - "3G"
        - Choose this option if you have less than 3Gb free on local disk.

#### --mailru-speedup-max-memory

Files larger than the size given below will always be hashed on disk.

- Config:      speedup_max_memory
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_SPEEDUP_MAX_MEMORY
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     32Mi
- Examples:
    - "0"
        - Preliminary hashing will always be done in a temporary disk location.
    - "32M"
        - Do not dedicate more than 32Mb RAM for preliminary hashing.
    - "256M"
        - You have at most 256Mb RAM free for hash calculations.

#### --mailru-check-hash

What should copy do if file checksum is mismatched or invalid.

- Config:      check_hash
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_CHECK_HASH

- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --mailru-quirks

Comma separated list of internal maintenance flags.

This option must not be used by an ordinary user. It is intended only to
facilitate remote troubleshooting of backend issues. Strict meaning of
flags is not documented and not guaranteed to persist between releases.
Quirks will be removed when the backend grows stable.
Supported quirks: atomicmkdir binlist unknowndirs

- Config:      quirks

- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --mailru-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MAILRU_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

File size limits depend on your account. A single file size is limited by 2G
for a free account and unlimited for paid tariffs. Please refer to the Mail.ru
site for the total uploaded size limits.

Note that Mailru is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

#  Mega

[Mega](https://mega.nz/) is a cloud storage and file hosting service
known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally
before they are uploaded. This prevents anyone (including employees of
Mega) from accessing the files without knowledge of the key used for
encryption.

This is an rclone backend for Mega which supports the file transfer
features of Mega using the same client side encryption.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Mega
   \ "mega"
[snip]
Storage> mega
User name
user> you@example.com
Password.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
type = mega
user = you@example.com
pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

**NOTE:** The encryption keys need to have been already generated after a regular login
via the browser, otherwise attempting to use the credentials in `rclone` will fail.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Mega

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Mega

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Mega directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes

Mega does not support modification times or hashes yet.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Duplicated files

Mega can have two files with exactly the same name and path (unlike a
normal file system).

Duplicated files cause problems with the syncing and you will see
messages in the log about duplicates.

Use `rclone dedupe` to fix duplicated files.

### Failure to log-in

Mega remotes seem to get blocked (reject logins) under "heavy use".
We haven't worked out the exact blocking rules but it seems to be
related to fast paced, successive rclone commands.

For example, executing this command 90 times in a row `rclone link
remote:file` will cause the remote to become "blocked". This is not an
abnormal situation, for example if you wish to get the public links of
a directory with hundred of files...  After more or less a week, the
remote will remote accept rclone logins normally again.

You can mitigate this issue by mounting the remote it with `rclone
mount`. This will log-in when mounting and a log-out when unmounting
only. You can also run `rclone rcd` and then use `rclone rc` to run
the commands over the API to avoid logging in each time.

Rclone does not currently close mega sessions (you can see them in the
web interface), however closing the sessions does not solve the issue.

If you space rclone commands by 3 seconds it will avoid blocking the
remote. We haven't identified the exact blocking rules, so perhaps one
could execute the command 80 times without waiting and avoid blocking
by waiting 3 seconds, then continuing...

Note that this has been observed by trial and error and might not be
set in stone.

Other tools seem not to produce this blocking effect, as they use a
different working approach (state-based, using sessionIDs instead of
log-in) which isn't compatible with the current stateless rclone
approach.

Note that once blocked, the use of other tools (such as megacmd) is
not a sure workaround: following megacmd login times have been
observed in succession for blocked remote: 7 minutes, 20 min, 30min, 30
min, 30min. Web access looks unaffected though.

Investigation is continuing in relation to workarounds based on
timeouts, pacers, retrials and tpslimits - if you discover something
relevant, please post on the forum.

So, if rclone was working nicely and suddenly you are unable to log-in
and you are sure the user and the password are correct, likely you
have got the remote blocked for a while.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to mega (Mega).

#### --mega-user

User name.

- Config:      user
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_USER
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --mega-pass

Password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_PASS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to mega (Mega).

#### --mega-debug

Output more debug from Mega.

If this flag is set (along with -vv) it will print further debugging
information from the mega backend.

- Config:      debug
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_DEBUG
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --mega-hard-delete

Delete files permanently rather than putting them into the trash.

Normally the mega backend will put all deletions into the trash rather
than permanently deleting them.  If you specify this then rclone will
permanently delete objects instead.

- Config:      hard_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_HARD_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --mega-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_MEGA_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

This backend uses the [go-mega go library](https://github.com/t3rm1n4l/go-mega) which is an opensource
go library implementing the Mega API. There doesn't appear to be any
documentation for the mega protocol beyond the [mega C++ SDK](https://github.com/meganz/sdk) source code
so there are likely quite a few errors still remaining in this library.

Mega allows duplicate files which may confuse rclone.

#  Memory

The memory backend is an in RAM backend. It does not persist its
data - use the local backend for that.

The memory backend behaves like a bucket based remote (e.g. like
s3). Because it has no parameters you can just use it with the
`:memory:` remote name.

## Configuration

You can configure it as a remote like this with `rclone config` too if
you want to:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Memory
   \ "memory"
[snip]
Storage> memory
** See help for memory backend at: https://rclone.org/memory/ **

Remote config

--------------------
[remote]
type = memory
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Because the memory backend isn't persistent it is most useful for
testing or with an rclone server or rclone mount, e.g.

    rclone mount :memory: /mnt/tmp
    rclone serve webdav :memory:
    rclone serve sftp :memory:

### Modified time and hashes

The memory backend supports MD5 hashes and modification times accurate to 1 nS.

### Restricted filename characters

The memory backend replaces the [default restricted characters
set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters).




#  Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g.
`remote:container/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
configuration.  For a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Microsoft Azure Blob Storage
   \ "azureblob"
[snip]
Storage> azureblob
Storage Account Name
account> account_name
Storage Account Key
key> base64encodedkey==
Endpoint for the service - leave blank normally.
endpoint> 
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
account = account_name
key = base64encodedkey==
endpoint = 
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote container, deleting any excess
files in the container.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:container

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object with the `mtime`
key.  It is stored using RFC3339 Format time with nanosecond
precision.  The metadata is supplied during directory listings so
there is no overhead to using it.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| .         | 0x2E  | ．          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Hashes

MD5 hashes are stored with blobs.  However blobs that were uploaded in
chunks only have an MD5 if the source remote was capable of MD5
hashes, e.g. the local disk.

### Authenticating with Azure Blob Storage

Rclone has 3 ways of authenticating with Azure Blob Storage:

#### Account and Key

This is the most straight forward and least flexible way.  Just fill
in the `account` and `key` lines and leave the rest blank.

#### SAS URL

This can be an account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL.

To use it leave `account`, `key` blank and fill in `sas_url`.

An account level SAS URL or container level SAS URL can be obtained
from the Azure portal or the Azure Storage Explorer.  To get a
container level SAS URL right click on a container in the Azure Blob
explorer in the Azure portal.

If you use a container level SAS URL, rclone operations are permitted
only on a particular container, e.g.

    rclone ls azureblob:container

You can also list the single container from the root. This will only
show the container specified by the SAS URL.

    $ rclone lsd azureblob:
    container/

Note that you can't see or access any other containers - this will
fail

    rclone ls azureblob:othercontainer

Container level SAS URLs are useful for temporarily allowing third
parties access to a single container or putting credentials into an
untrusted environment such as a CI build server.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure Blob Storage).

#### --azureblob-account

Storage Account Name.

Leave blank to use SAS URL or Emulator.

- Config:      account
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCOUNT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-service-principal-file

Path to file containing credentials for use with a service principal.

Leave blank normally. Needed only if you want to use a service principal instead of interactive login.

    $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<name>" \
      --role "Storage Blob Data Owner" \
      --scopes "/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account>/blobServices/default/containers/<container>" \
      > azure-principal.json

See ["Create an Azure service principal"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli) and ["Assign an Azure role for access to blob data"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac-cli) pages for more details.


- Config:      service_principal_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_FILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-key

Storage Account Key.

Leave blank to use SAS URL or Emulator.

- Config:      key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_KEY
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-sas-url

SAS URL for container level access only.

Leave blank if using account/key or Emulator.

- Config:      sas_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_SAS_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-use-msi

Use a managed service identity to authenticate (only works in Azure).

When true, use a [managed service identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/)
to authenticate to Azure Storage instead of a SAS token or account key.

If the VM(SS) on which this program is running has a system-assigned identity, it will
be used by default. If the resource has no system-assigned but exactly one user-assigned identity,
the user-assigned identity will be used by default. If the resource has multiple user-assigned
identities, the identity to use must be explicitly specified using exactly one of the msi_object_id,
msi_client_id, or msi_mi_res_id parameters.

- Config:      use_msi
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_MSI
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-use-emulator

Uses local storage emulator if provided as 'true'.

Leave blank if using real azure storage endpoint.

- Config:      use_emulator
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_USE_EMULATOR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to azureblob (Microsoft Azure Blob Storage).

#### --azureblob-msi-object-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

- Config:      msi_object_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_OBJECT_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-msi-client-id

Object ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_object_id or msi_mi_res_id specified.

- Config:      msi_client_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_CLIENT_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-msi-mi-res-id

Azure resource ID of the user-assigned MSI to use, if any.

Leave blank if msi_client_id or msi_object_id specified.

- Config:      msi_mi_res_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MSI_MI_RES_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-endpoint

Endpoint for the service.

Leave blank normally.

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload (<= 256 MiB) (deprecated).

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-chunk-size

Upload chunk size (<= 100 MiB).

Note that this is stored in memory and there may be up to
"--transfers" chunks stored at once in memory.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4Mi

#### --azureblob-list-chunk

Size of blob list.

This sets the number of blobs requested in each listing chunk. Default
is the maximum, 5000. "List blobs" requests are permitted 2 minutes
per megabyte to complete. If an operation is taking longer than 2
minutes per megabyte on average, it will time out (
[source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/setting-timeouts-for-blob-service-operations#exceptions-to-default-timeout-interval)
). This can be used to limit the number of blobs items to return, to
avoid the time out.

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     5000

#### --azureblob-access-tier

Access tier of blob: hot, cool or archive.

Archived blobs can be restored by setting access tier to hot or
cool. Leave blank if you intend to use default access tier, which is
set at account level

If there is no "access tier" specified, rclone doesn't apply any tier.
rclone performs "Set Tier" operation on blobs while uploading, if objects
are not modified, specifying "access tier" to new one will have no effect.
If blobs are in "archive tier" at remote, trying to perform data transfer
operations from remote will not be allowed. User should first restore by
tiering blob to "Hot" or "Cool".

- Config:      access_tier
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ACCESS_TIER
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --azureblob-archive-tier-delete

Delete archive tier blobs before overwriting.

Archive tier blobs cannot be updated. So without this flag, if you
attempt to update an archive tier blob, then rclone will produce the
error:

    can't update archive tier blob without --azureblob-archive-tier-delete

With this flag set then before rclone attempts to overwrite an archive
tier blob, it will delete the existing blob before uploading its
replacement.  This has the potential for data loss if the upload fails
(unlike updating a normal blob) and also may cost more since deleting
archive tier blobs early may be chargable.


- Config:      archive_tier_delete
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ARCHIVE_TIER_DELETE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-disable-checksum

Don't store MD5 checksum with object metadata.

Normally rclone will calculate the MD5 checksum of the input before
uploading it so it can add it to metadata on the object. This is great
for data integrity checking but can cause long delays for large files
to start uploading.

- Config:      disable_checksum
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_DISABLE_CHECKSUM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-memory-pool-flush-time

How often internal memory buffer pools will be flushed.

Uploads which requires additional buffers (f.e multipart) will use memory pool for allocations.
This option controls how often unused buffers will be removed from the pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_flush_time
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MEMORY_POOL_FLUSH_TIME
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s

#### --azureblob-memory-pool-use-mmap

Whether to use mmap buffers in internal memory pool.

- Config:      memory_pool_use_mmap
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_MEMORY_POOL_USE_MMAP
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --azureblob-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8

#### --azureblob-public-access

Public access level of a container: blob or container.

- Config:      public_access
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_PUBLIC_ACCESS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - ""
        - The container and its blobs can be accessed only with an authorized request.
        - It's a default value.
    - "blob"
        - Blob data within this container can be read via anonymous request.
    - "container"
        - Allow full public read access for container and blob data.

#### --azureblob-no-head-object

If set, do not do HEAD before GET when getting objects.

- Config:      no_head_object
- Env Var:     RCLONE_AZUREBLOB_NO_HEAD_OBJECT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false



## Limitations

MD5 sums are only uploaded with chunked files if the source has an MD5
sum.  This will always be the case for a local to azure copy.

`rclone about` is not supported by the Microsoft Azure Blob storage backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

## Azure Storage Emulator Support

You can test rclone with storage emulator locally, to do this make sure azure storage emulator
installed locally and set up a new remote with `rclone config` follow instructions described in
introduction, set `use_emulator` config as `true`, you do not need to provide default account name
or key if using emulator.

#  Microsoft OneDrive

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for OneDrive involves getting a token from
Microsoft which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks
you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Microsoft. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification
code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require
you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your OneDrive

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OneDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OneDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Getting your own Client ID and Key

You can use your own Client ID if the default (`client_id` left blank)
one doesn't work for you or you see lots of throttling. The default
Client ID and Key is shared by all rclone users when performing
requests.

If you are having problems with them (E.g., seeing a lot of throttling), you can get your own
Client ID and Key by following the steps below:

1. Open https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade and then click `New registration`.
2. Enter a name for your app, choose account type `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`, select `Web` in `Redirect URI`, then type (do not copy and paste) `http://localhost:53682/` and click Register. Copy and keep the `Application (client) ID` under the app name for later use.
3. Under `manage` select `Certificates & secrets`, click `New client secret`. Enter a description (can be anything) and set `Expires` to 24 months. Copy and keep that secret _Value_ for later use (you _won't_ be able to see this value afterwards).
4. Under `manage` select `API permissions`, click `Add a permission` and select `Microsoft Graph` then select `delegated permissions`.
5. Search and select the following permissions: `Files.Read`, `Files.ReadWrite`, `Files.Read.All`, `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `offline_access`, `User.Read`. Once selected click `Add permissions` at the bottom.

Now the application is complete. Run `rclone config` to create or edit a OneDrive remote.
Supply the app ID and password as Client ID and Secret, respectively. rclone will walk you through the remaining steps.

### Modification time and hashes

OneDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

OneDrive personal supports SHA1 type hashes. OneDrive for business and
Sharepoint Server support
[QuickXorHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/code-snippets/quickxorhash).

For all types of OneDrive you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

File names can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| .         | 0x2E  | ．          |

File names can also not begin with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| ~         | 0x7E  | ～          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Deleting files

Any files you delete with rclone will end up in the trash.  Microsoft
doesn't provide an API to permanently delete files, nor to empty the
trash, so you will have to do that with one of Microsoft's apps or via
the OneDrive website.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to onedrive (Microsoft OneDrive).

#### --onedrive-client-id

OAuth Client Id.

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to onedrive (Microsoft OneDrive).

#### --onedrive-token

OAuth Access Token as a JSON blob.

- Config:      token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --onedrive-auth-url

Auth server URL.

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      auth_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_AUTH_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --onedrive-token-url

Leave blank to use the provider defaults.

- Config:      token_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_TOKEN_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --onedrive-chunk-size

Chunk size to upload files with - must be multiple of 320k (327,680 bytes).

Above this size files will be chunked - must be multiple of 320k (327,680 bytes) and
should not exceed 250M (262,144,000 bytes) else you may encounter \"Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.InvalidClientQueryException: The request message is too big.\"
Note that the chunks will be buffered into memory.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Mi

#### --onedrive-drive-id

The ID of the drive to use.

- Config:      drive_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_ID
- Type:        string

- Config:      drive_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_DRIVE_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --onedrive-expose-onenote-files

Set to make OneNote files show up in directory listings.

By default rclone will hide OneNote files in directory listings because
operations like "Open" and "Update" won't work on them.  But this
behaviour may also prevent you from deleting them.  If you want to
delete OneNote files or otherwise want them to show up in directory
listing, set this option.

- Config:      expose_onenote_files
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_EXPOSE_ONENOTE_FILES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-server-side-across-configs

Allow server-side operations (e.g. copy) to work across different onedrive configs.

This will only work if you are copying between two OneDrive *Personal* drives AND
the files to copy are already shared between them.  In other cases, rclone will
fall back to normal copy (which will be slightly slower).

- Config:      server_side_across_configs
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_SERVER_SIDE_ACROSS_CONFIGS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-list-chunk

Size of listing chunk.

- Config:      list_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LIST_CHUNK
- Type:        int
- Default:     1000

#### --onedrive-no-versions

Remove all versions on modifying operations.

Onedrive for business creates versions when rclone uploads new files
overwriting an existing one and when it sets the modification time.

These versions take up space out of the quota.

This flag checks for versions after file upload and setting
modification time and removes all but the last version.

**NB** Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions so don't use
this flag there.


- Config:      no_versions
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_NO_VERSIONS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --onedrive-link-scope

Set the scope of the links created by the link command.

- Config:      link_scope
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_SCOPE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "anonymous"
- Examples:
    - "anonymous"
        - Anyone with the link has access, without needing to sign in.
        - This may include people outside of your organization.
        - Anonymous link support may be disabled by an administrator.
    - "organization"
        - Anyone signed into your organization (tenant) can use the link to get access.
        - Only available in OneDrive for Business and SharePoint.

#### --onedrive-link-type

Set the type of the links created by the link command.

- Config:      link_type
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_TYPE
- Type:        string
- Default:     "view"
- Examples:
    - "view"
        - Creates a read-only link to the item.
    - "edit"
        - Creates a read-write link to the item.
    - "embed"
        - Creates an embeddable link to the item.

#### --onedrive-link-password

Set the password for links created by the link command.

At the time of writing this only works with OneDrive personal paid accounts.


- Config:      link_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_LINK_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --onedrive-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_ONEDRIVE_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,LeftSpace,LeftTilde,RightSpace,RightPeriod,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

If you don't use rclone for 90 days the refresh token will
expire. This will result in authorization problems. This is easy to
fix by running the `rclone config reconnect remote:` command to get a
new token and refresh token.

### Naming

Note that OneDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OneDrive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `？` instead.

### File sizes

The largest allowed file size is 250 GiB for both OneDrive Personal and OneDrive for Business [(Updated 13 Jan 2021)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us#individualfilesize).

### Path length

The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400 characters for OneDrive, OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. If you are encrypting file and folder names with rclone, you may want to pay attention to this limitation because the encrypted names are typically longer than the original ones.

### Number of files

OneDrive seems to be OK with at least 50,000 files in a folder, but at
100,000 rclone will get errors listing the directory like `couldn’t
list files: UnknownError:`.  See
[#2707](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2707) for more info.

An official document about the limitations for different types of OneDrive can be found [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/invalid-file-names-and-file-types-in-onedrive-onedrive-for-business-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa).

## Versions

Every change in a file OneDrive causes the service to create a new
version of the the file.  This counts against a users quota.  For
example changing the modification time of a file creates a second
version, so the file apparently uses twice the space.

For example the `copy` command is affected by this as rclone copies
the file and then afterwards sets the modification time to match the
source file which uses another version.

You can use the `rclone cleanup` command (see below) to remove all old
versions.

Or you can set the `no_versions` parameter to `true` and rclone will
remove versions after operations which create new versions. This takes
extra transactions so only enable it if you need it.

**Note** At the time of writing Onedrive Personal creates versions
(but not for setting the modification time) but the API for removing
them returns "API not found" so cleanup and `no_versions` should not
be used on Onedrive Personal.

### Disabling versioning

Starting October 2018, users will no longer be able to
disable versioning by default. This is because Microsoft has brought
an
[update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-OneDrive-Blog/New-Updates-to-OneDrive-and-SharePoint-Team-Site-Versioning/ba-p/204390)
to the mechanism. To change this new default setting, a PowerShell
command is required to be run by a SharePoint admin. If you are an
admin, you can run these commands in PowerShell to change that
setting:

1. `Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell` (in case you haven't installed this already)
2. `Import-Module Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell -DisableNameChecking`
3. `Connect-SPOService -Url https://YOURSITE-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential YOU@YOURSITE.COM` (replacing `YOURSITE`, `YOU`, `YOURSITE.COM` with the actual values; this will prompt for your credentials)
4. `Set-SPOTenant -EnableMinimumVersionRequirement $False`
5. `Disconnect-SPOService` (to disconnect from the server)

*Below are the steps for normal users to disable versioning. If you don't see the "No Versioning" option, make sure the above requirements are met.*  

User [Weropol](https://github.com/Weropol) has found a method to disable
versioning on OneDrive

1. Open the settings menu by clicking on the gear symbol at the top of the OneDrive Business page.
2. Click Site settings.
3. Once on the Site settings page, navigate to Site Administration > Site libraries and lists.
4. Click Customize "Documents".
5. Click General Settings > Versioning Settings.
6. Under Document Version History select the option No versioning.
Note: This will disable the creation of new file versions, but will not remove any previous versions. Your documents are safe.
7. Apply the changes by clicking OK.
8. Use rclone to upload or modify files. (I also use the --no-update-modtime flag)
9. Restore the versioning settings after using rclone. (Optional)

## Cleanup

OneDrive supports `rclone cleanup` which causes rclone to look through
every file under the path supplied and delete all version but the
current version. Because this involves traversing all the files, then
querying each file for versions it can be quite slow. Rclone does
`--checkers` tests in parallel. The command also supports `-i` which
is a great way to see what it would do.

    rclone cleanup -i remote:path/subdir # interactively remove all old version for path/subdir
    rclone cleanup remote:path/subdir    # unconditionally remove all old version for path/subdir

**NB** Onedrive personal can't currently delete versions

## Troubleshooting ##

### Excessive throttling or blocked on SharePoint

If you experience excessive throttling or is being blocked on SharePoint then it may help to set the user agent explicitly with a flag like this: `--user-agent "ISV|rclone.org|rclone/v1.55.1"`  
 
The specific details can be found in the Microsoft document: [Avoid getting throttled or blocked in SharePoint Online](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/how-to-avoid-getting-throttled-or-blocked-in-sharepoint-online#how-to-decorate-your-http-traffic-to-avoid-throttling)

### Unexpected file size/hash differences on Sharepoint ####

It is a
[known](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/935#issuecomment-441741631)
issue that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) silently modifies
uploaded files, mainly Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.), causing file size and
hash checks to fail. There are also other situations that will cause OneDrive to 
report inconsistent file sizes. To use rclone with such
affected files on Sharepoint, you
may disable these checks with the following command line arguments:

```
--ignore-checksum --ignore-size
```

Alternatively, if you have write access to the OneDrive files, it may be possible
to fix this problem for certain files, by attempting the steps below.
Open the web interface for [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com) and find the 
affected files (which will be in the error messages/log for rclone). Simply click on
each of these files, causing OneDrive to open them on the web. This will cause each 
file to be converted in place to a format that is functionally equivalent
but which will no longer trigger the size discrepancy. Once all problematic files
are converted you will no longer need the ignore options above.

### Replacing/deleting existing files on Sharepoint gets "item not found" ####

It is a [known](https://github.com/OneDrive/onedrive-api-docs/issues/1068) issue
that Sharepoint (not OneDrive or OneDrive for Business) may return "item not
found" errors when users try to replace or delete uploaded files; this seems to
mainly affect Office files (.docx, .xlsx, etc.). As a workaround, you may use
the `--backup-dir <BACKUP_DIR>` command line argument so rclone moves the
files to be replaced/deleted into a given backup directory (instead of directly
replacing/deleting them). For example, to instruct rclone to move the files into
the directory `rclone-backup-dir` on backend `mysharepoint`, you may use:

```
--backup-dir mysharepoint:rclone-backup-dir
```

### access\_denied (AADSTS65005) ####

```
Error: access_denied
Code: AADSTS65005
Description: Using application 'rclone' is currently not supported for your organization [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] because it is in an unmanaged state. An administrator needs to claim ownership of the company by DNS validation of [YOUR_ORGANIZATION] before the application rclone can be provisioned.
```

This means that rclone can't use the OneDrive for Business API with your account. You can't do much about it, maybe write an email to your admins.

However, there are other ways to interact with your OneDrive account. Have a look at the webdav backend: https://rclone.org/webdav/#sharepoint

### invalid\_grant (AADSTS50076) ####

```
Error: invalid_grant
Code: AADSTS50076
Description: Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must use multi-factor authentication to access '...'.
```

If you see the error above after enabling multi-factor authentication for your account, you can fix it by refreshing your OAuth refresh token. To do that, run `rclone config`, and choose to edit your OneDrive backend. Then, you don't need to actually make any changes until you reach this question: `Already have a token - refresh?`. For this question, answer `y` and go through the process to refresh your token, just like the first time the backend is configured. After this, rclone should work again for this backend.

### Invalid request when making public links ####

On Sharepoint and OneDrive for Business, `rclone link` may return an "Invalid
request" error. A possible cause is that the organisation admin didn't allow
public links to be made for the organisation/sharepoint library. To fix the
permissions as an admin, take a look at the docs:
[1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/turn-external-sharing-on-or-off),
[2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/set-up-and-manage-access-requests-94b26e0b-2822-49d4-929a-8455698654b3).

#  OpenDrive

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your OpenDrive

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an OpenDrive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and MD5SUMs

OpenDrive allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second. These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| *         | 0x2A  | ＊          |
| :         | 0x3A  | ：          |
| <         | 0x3C  | ＜          |
| >         | 0x3E  | ＞          |
| ?         | 0x3F  | ？          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜          |

File names can also not begin or end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the first or last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| HT        | 0x09  | ␉           |

| CR        | 0x0D  | ␍           |


Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to opendrive (OpenDrive).

#### --opendrive-username

Username.

- Config:      username
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OPENDRIVE_USERNAME
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --opendrive-password

Password.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OPENDRIVE_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to opendrive (OpenDrive).

#### --opendrive-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OPENDRIVE_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,Colon,Question,Asterisk,Pipe,BackSlash,LeftSpace,LeftCrLfHtVt,RightSpace,RightCrLfHtVt,InvalidUtf8,Dot

#### --opendrive-chunk-size

Files will be uploaded in chunks this size.

Note that these chunks are buffered in memory so increasing them will
increase memory use.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_OPENDRIVE_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     10Mi



## Limitations

Note that OpenDrive is case insensitive so you can't have a
file called "Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

There are quite a few characters that can't be in OpenDrive file
names.  These can't occur on Windows platforms, but on non-Windows
platforms they are common.  Rclone will map these names to and from an
identical looking unicode equivalent.  For example if a file has a `?`
in it will be mapped to `？` instead.

`rclone about` is not supported by the OpenDrive backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

#  QingStor

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an QingStor configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/r/c/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / QingStor Object Storage
   \ "qingstor"
[snip]
Storage> qingstor
Get QingStor credentials from runtime. Only applies if access_key_id and secret_access_key is blank.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Enter QingStor credentials in the next step
   \ "false"
 2 / Get QingStor credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM)
   \ "true"
env_auth> 1
QingStor Access Key ID - leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
access_key_id> access_key
QingStor Secret Access Key (password) - leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.
secret_access_key> secret_key
Enter an endpoint URL to connection QingStor API.
Leave blank will use the default value "https://qingstor.com:443"
endpoint>
Zone connect to. Default is "pek3a".
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
   / The Beijing (China) Three Zone

   \ "pek3a"
   / The Shanghai (China) First Zone
 2 | Needs location constraint sh1a.
   \ "sh1a"
zone> 1
Number of connection retry.
Leave blank will use the default value "3".
connection_retries>
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
env_auth = false
access_key_id = access_key
secret_access_key = secret_key
endpoint =
zone = pek3a
connection_retries =
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:bucket

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### Multipart uploads

rclone supports multipart uploads with QingStor which means that it can
upload files bigger than 5 GiB. Note that files uploaded with multipart
upload don't have an MD5SUM.

Note that incomplete multipart uploads older than 24 hours can be
removed with `rclone cleanup remote:bucket` just for one bucket
`rclone cleanup remote:` for all buckets. QingStor does not ever
remove incomplete multipart uploads so it may be necessary to run this
from time to time.

### Buckets and Zone

With QingStor you can list buckets (`rclone lsd`) using any zone,
but you can only access the content of a bucket from the zone it was
created in.  If you attempt to access a bucket from the wrong zone,
you will get an error, `incorrect zone, the bucket is not in 'XXX'
zone`.

### Authentication

There are two ways to supply `rclone` with a set of QingStor
credentials. In order of precedence:

 - Directly in the rclone configuration file (as configured by `rclone config`)
   - set `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key`
 - Runtime configuration:
   - set `env_auth` to `true` in the config file
   - Exporting the following environment variables before running `rclone`
     - Access Key ID: `QS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `QS_ACCESS_KEY`
     - Secret Access Key: `QS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `QS_SECRET_KEY`

### Restricted filename characters

The control characters 0x00-0x1F and / are replaced as in the [default
restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters).  Note
that 0x7F is not replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to qingstor (QingCloud Object Storage).

#### --qingstor-env-auth

Get QingStor credentials from runtime.

Only applies if access_key_id and secret_access_key is blank.

- Config:      env_auth
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ENV_AUTH
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "false"
        - Enter QingStor credentials in the next step.
    - "true"
        - Get QingStor credentials from the environment (env vars or IAM).

#### --qingstor-access-key-id

QingStor Access Key ID.

Leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.

- Config:      access_key_id
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --qingstor-secret-access-key

QingStor Secret Access Key (password).

Leave blank for anonymous access or runtime credentials.

- Config:      secret_access_key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --qingstor-endpoint

Enter an endpoint URL to connection QingStor API.

Leave blank will use the default value "https://qingstor.com:443".

- Config:      endpoint
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ENDPOINT
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --qingstor-zone

Zone to connect to.

Default is "pek3a".

- Config:      zone
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ZONE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "pek3a"
        - The Beijing (China) Three Zone.
        - Needs location constraint pek3a.
    - "sh1a"
        - The Shanghai (China) First Zone.
        - Needs location constraint sh1a.
    - "gd2a"
        - The Guangdong (China) Second Zone.
        - Needs location constraint gd2a.

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to qingstor (QingCloud Object Storage).

#### --qingstor-connection-retries

Number of connection retries.

- Config:      connection_retries
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CONNECTION_RETRIES
- Type:        int
- Default:     3

#### --qingstor-upload-cutoff

Cutoff for switching to chunked upload.

Any files larger than this will be uploaded in chunks of chunk_size.
The minimum is 0 and the maximum is 5 GiB.

- Config:      upload_cutoff
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CUTOFF
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     200Mi

#### --qingstor-chunk-size

Chunk size to use for uploading.

When uploading files larger than upload_cutoff they will be uploaded
as multipart uploads using this chunk size.

Note that "--qingstor-upload-concurrency" chunks of this size are buffered
in memory per transfer.

If you are transferring large files over high-speed links and you have
enough memory, then increasing this will speed up the transfers.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     4Mi

#### --qingstor-upload-concurrency

Concurrency for multipart uploads.

This is the number of chunks of the same file that are uploaded
concurrently.

NB if you set this to > 1 then the checksums of multipart uploads
become corrupted (the uploads themselves are not corrupted though).

If you are uploading small numbers of large files over high-speed links
and these uploads do not fully utilize your bandwidth, then increasing
this may help to speed up the transfers.

- Config:      upload_concurrency
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY
- Type:        int
- Default:     1

#### --qingstor-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_QINGSTOR_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,Ctl,InvalidUtf8



## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the qingstor backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)

#  Sia

Sia ([sia.tech](https://sia.tech/)) is a decentralized cloud storage platform
based on the [blockchain](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology.
With rclone you can use it like any other remote filesystem or mount Sia folders
locally. The technology behind it involves a number of new concepts such as
Siacoins and Wallet, Blockchain and Consensus, Renting and Hosting, and so on.
If you are new to it, you'd better first familiarize yourself using their
excellent [support documentation](https://support.sia.tech/).

## Introduction

Before you can use rclone with Sia, you will need to have a running copy of
`Sia-UI` or `siad` (the Sia daemon) locally on your computer or on local
network (e.g. a NAS). Please follow the [Get started](https://sia.tech/get-started)
guide and install one.

rclone interacts with Sia network by talking to the Sia daemon via [HTTP API](https://sia.tech/docs/)
which is usually available on port _9980_. By default you will run the daemon
locally on the same computer so it's safe to leave the API password blank
(the API URL will be `http://127.0.0.1:9980` making external access impossible).

However, if you want to access Sia daemon running on another node, for example
due to memory constraints or because you want to share single daemon between
several rclone and Sia-UI instances, you'll need to make a few more provisions:
- Ensure you have _Sia daemon_ installed directly or in
  a [docker container](https://github.com/SiaFoundation/siad/pkgs/container/siad)
  because Sia-UI does not support this mode natively.
- Run it on externally accessible port, for example provide `--api-addr :9980`
  and `--disable-api-security` arguments on the daemon command line.
- Enforce API password for the `siad` daemon via environment variable
  `SIA_API_PASSWORD` or text file named `apipassword` in the daemon directory.
- Set rclone backend option `api_password` taking it from above locations.


Notes:
1. If your wallet is locked, rclone cannot unlock it automatically.
   You should either unlock it in advance by using Sia-UI or via command line
   `siac wallet unlock`.
   Alternatively you can make `siad` unlock your wallet automatically upon
   startup by running it with environment variable `SIA_WALLET_PASSWORD`.
2. If `siad` cannot find the `SIA_API_PASSWORD` variable or the `apipassword` file
   in the `SIA_DIR` directory, it will generate a random password and store in the
   text file named `apipassword` under `YOUR_HOME/.sia/` directory on Unix
   or `C:\Users\YOUR_HOME\AppData\Local\Sia\apipassword` on Windows.
   Remember this when you configure password in rclone.
3. The only way to use `siad` without API password is to run it **on localhost**
   with command line argument `--authorize-api=false`, but this is insecure and
   **strongly discouraged**.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a `sia` remote called `mySia`.
First, run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> mySia
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
...
29 / Sia Decentralized Cloud
   \ "sia"
...
Storage> sia
Sia daemon API URL, like http://sia.daemon.host:9980.
Note that siad must run with --disable-api-security to open API port for other hosts (not recommended).
Keep default if Sia daemon runs on localhost.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("http://127.0.0.1:9980").
api_url> http://127.0.0.1:9980
Sia Daemon API Password.
Can be found in the apipassword file located in HOME/.sia/ or in the daemon directory.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
Edit advanced config?
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
--------------------
[mySia]
type = sia
api_url = http://127.0.0.1:9980
api_password = *** ENCRYPTED ***
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured, you can then use `rclone` like this:

- List directories in top level of your Sia storage

```
rclone lsd mySia:
```

- List all the files in your Sia storage

```
rclone ls mySia:
```

- Upload a local directory to the Sia directory called _backup_

```
rclone copy /home/source mySia:backup
```


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to sia (Sia Decentralized Cloud).

#### --sia-api-url

Sia daemon API URL, like http://sia.daemon.host:9980.

Note that siad must run with --disable-api-security to open API port for other hosts (not recommended).
Keep default if Sia daemon runs on localhost.

- Config:      api_url
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SIA_API_URL
- Type:        string
- Default:     "http://127.0.0.1:9980"

#### --sia-api-password

Sia Daemon API Password.

Can be found in the apipassword file located in HOME/.sia/ or in the daemon directory.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      api_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SIA_API_PASSWORD
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to sia (Sia Decentralized Cloud).

#### --sia-user-agent

Siad User Agent

Sia daemon requires the 'Sia-Agent' user agent by default for security

- Config:      user_agent
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SIA_USER_AGENT
- Type:        string
- Default:     "Sia-Agent"

#### --sia-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SIA_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,Question,Hash,Percent,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

- Modification times not supported
- Checksums not supported
- `rclone about` not supported
- rclone can work only with _Siad_ or _Sia-UI_ at the moment,
  the **SkyNet daemon is not supported yet.**
- Sia does not allow control characters or symbols like question and pound
  signs in file names. rclone will transparently [encode](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding)
  them for you, but you'd better be aware

# Swift

Swift refers to [OpenStack Object Storage](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/).
Commercial implementations of that being:

  * [Rackspace Cloud Files](https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/files/)
  * [Memset Memstore](https://www.memset.com/cloud/storage/)
  * [OVH Object Storage](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/storage/object-storage/)
  * [Oracle Cloud Storage](https://cloud.oracle.com/object-storage/buckets)
  * [IBM Bluemix Cloud ObjectStorage Swift](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/infrastructure/objectstorage-swift/index.html)

Paths are specified as `remote:container` (or `remote:` for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:container/path/to/dir`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a swift configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all containers

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new container

    rclone mkdir remote:container

List the contents of a container

    rclone ls remote:container

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote container, deleting any
excess files in the container.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:container

### Configuration from an OpenStack credentials file

An OpenStack credentials file typically looks something something
like this (without the comments)

```
export OS_AUTH_URL=https://a.provider.net/v2.0
export OS_TENANT_ID=ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
export OS_TENANT_NAME="1234567890123456"
export OS_USERNAME="123abc567xy"
echo "Please enter your OpenStack Password: "
read -sr OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_PASSWORD=$OS_PASSWORD_INPUT
export OS_REGION_NAME="SBG1"
if [ -z "$OS_REGION_NAME" ]; then unset OS_REGION_NAME; fi
```

The config file needs to look something like this where `$OS_USERNAME`
represents the value of the `OS_USERNAME` variable - `123abc567xy` in
the example above.

```
[remote]
type = swift
user = $OS_USERNAME
key = $OS_PASSWORD
auth = $OS_AUTH_URL
tenant = $OS_TENANT_NAME
```

Note that you may (or may not) need to set `region` too - try without first.

### Configuration from the environment

If you prefer you can configure rclone to use swift using a standard
set of OpenStack environment variables.

When you run through the config, make sure you choose `true` for
`env_auth` and leave everything else blank.

rclone will then set any empty config parameters from the environment
using standard OpenStack environment variables.  There is [a list of
the
variables](https://godoc.org/github.com/ncw/swift#Connection.ApplyEnvironment)
in the docs for the swift library.

### Using an alternate authentication method

If your OpenStack installation uses a non-standard authentication method
that might not be yet supported by rclone or the underlying swift library, 
you can authenticate externally (e.g. calling manually the `openstack` 
commands to get a token). Then, you just need to pass the two 
configuration variables ``auth_token`` and ``storage_url``. 
If they are both provided, the other variables are ignored. rclone will 
not try to authenticate but instead assume it is already authenticated 
and use these two variables to access the OpenStack installation.

#### Using rclone without a config file

You can use rclone with swift without a config file, if desired, like
this:

```
source openstack-credentials-file
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_TYPE=swift
export RCLONE_CONFIG_MYREMOTE_ENV_AUTH=true
rclone lsd myremote:
```

### --fast-list

This remote supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.

### --update and --use-server-modtime

As noted below, the modified time is stored on metadata on the object. It is
used by default for all operations that require checking the time a file was
last updated. It allows rclone to treat the remote more like a true filesystem,
but it is inefficient because it requires an extra API call to retrieve the
metadata.

For many operations, the time the object was last uploaded to the remote is
sufficient to determine if it is "dirty". By using `--update` along with
`--use-server-modtime`, you can avoid the extra API call and simply upload
files whose local modtime is newer than the time it was last uploaded.

### Modified time

The modified time is stored as metadata on the object as
`X-Object-Meta-Mtime` as floating point since the epoch accurate to 1
ns.

This is a de facto standard (used in the official python-swiftclient
amongst others) for storing the modification time for an object.

### Restricted filename characters

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

    - "pca"
        - OVH Public Cloud Archive

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to swift (OpenStack Swift (Rackspace Cloud Files, Memset Memstore, OVH)).

#### --swift-leave-parts-on-error

If true avoid calling abort upload on a failure.

It should be set to true for resuming uploads across different sessions.

- Config:      leave_parts_on_error
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_LEAVE_PARTS_ON_ERROR
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --swift-chunk-size

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.

Above this size files will be chunked into a _segments container.  The
default for this is 5 GiB which is its maximum value.

- Config:      chunk_size
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_CHUNK_SIZE
- Type:        SizeSuffix
- Default:     5Gi

#### --swift-no-chunk

Don't chunk files during streaming upload.

When doing streaming uploads (e.g. using rcat or mount) setting this
flag will cause the swift backend to not upload chunked files.

This will limit the maximum upload size to 5 GiB. However non chunked
files are easier to deal with and have an MD5SUM.

Rclone will still chunk files bigger than chunk_size when doing normal
copy operations.

- Config:      no_chunk
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_NO_CHUNK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --swift-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SWIFT_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,InvalidUtf8



## Limitations

The Swift API doesn't return a correct MD5SUM for segmented files
(Dynamic or Static Large Objects) so rclone won't check or use the
MD5SUM for these.

## Troubleshooting

### Rclone gives Failed to create file system for "remote:": Bad Request

Due to an oddity of the underlying swift library, it gives a "Bad
Request" error rather than a more sensible error when the
authentication fails for Swift.

So this most likely means your username / password is wrong.  You can
investigate further with the `--dump-bodies` flag.

This may also be caused by specifying the region when you shouldn't
have (e.g. OVH).

### Rclone gives Failed to create file system: Response didn't have storage url and auth token

This is most likely caused by forgetting to specify your tenant when
setting up a swift remote.

## OVH Cloud Archive

To use rclone with OVH cloud archive, first use `rclone config` to set up a `swift` backend with OVH, choosing `pca` as the `storage_policy`.

### Uploading Objects

Uploading objects to OVH cloud archive is no different to object storage, you just simply run the command you like (move, copy or sync) to upload the objects. Once uploaded the objects will show in a "Frozen" state within the OVH control panel.

### Retrieving Objects

To retrieve objects use `rclone copy` as normal. If the objects are in a frozen state then rclone will ask for them all to be unfrozen and it will wait at the end of the output with a message like the following:

`2019/03/23 13:06:33 NOTICE: Received retry after error - sleeping until 2019-03-23T13:16:33.481657164+01:00 (9m59.99985121s)`

Rclone will wait for the time specified then retry the copy.

#  pCloud

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which you
need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Pcloud
   \ "pcloud"
[snip]
Storage> pcloud
Pcloud App Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id> 
Pcloud App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
client_secret> 
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your pCloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your pCloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an pCloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes ###

pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.  In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object
be re-uploaded.

pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the US region, and SHA1 and SHA256
hashes in the EU region, so you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the trash.  Your subscription level
will determine how long items stay in the trash.  `rclone cleanup` can
be used to empty the trash.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your pCloud drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the `folder` field
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the pCloud web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&folder=5xxxxxxxx8&tpl=foldergrid`
in the browser, then you use `5xxxxxxxx8` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an premiumize.me directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes

premiumize.me does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to `--size-only` checking.  Note that using
`--update` will work.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to premiumizeme (premiumize.me).

#### --premiumizeme-api-key

API Key.

This is not normally used - use oauth instead.


- Config:      api_key
- Env Var:     RCLONE_PREMIUMIZEME_API_KEY
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to premiumizeme (premiumize.me).

#### --premiumizeme-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Env Var:     RCLONE_PREMIUMIZEME_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,DoubleQuote,BackSlash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Note that premiumize.me is case insensitive so you can't have a file called
"Hello.doc" and one called "hello.doc".

premiumize.me file names can't have the `\` or `"` characters in.
rclone maps these to and from an identical looking unicode equivalents
`＼` and `＂`

premiumize.me only supports filenames up to 255 characters in length.

#  put.io

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

put.io paths may be as deep as required, e.g.
`remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for put.io involves getting a token from put.io
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you

runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you get back
the verification code.  This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this
it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are running a host

# Seafile

This is a backend for the [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/) storage service:
- It works with both the free community edition or the professional edition.
- Seafile versions 6.x and 7.x are all supported.
- Encrypted libraries are also supported.
- It supports 2FA enabled users

## Configuration

There are two distinct modes you can setup your remote:
- you point your remote to the **root of the server**, meaning you don't specify a library during the configuration:
Paths are specified as `remote:library`. You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:library/path/to/dir`.
- you point your remote to a specific library during the configuration:
Paths are specified as `remote:path/to/dir`. **This is the recommended mode when using encrypted libraries**. (_This mode is possibly slightly faster than the root mode_)

### Configuration in root mode

Here is an example of making a seafile configuration for a user with **no** two-factor authentication.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process. To authenticate
you will need the URL of your server, your email (or username) and your password.

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> seafile
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Seafile
   \ "seafile"
[snip]
Storage> seafile
** See help for seafile backend at: https://rclone.org/seafile/ **

URL of seafile host to connect to
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to cloud.seafile.com
   \ "https://cloud.seafile.com/"
url> http://my.seafile.server/
User name (usually email address)
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
user> me@example.com
Password
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
Two-factor authentication ('true' if the account has 2FA enabled)
Enter a boolean value (true or false). Press Enter for the default ("false").
2fa> false
Name of the library. Leave blank to access all non-encrypted libraries.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").
library>
Library password (for encrypted libraries only). Leave blank if you pass it through the command line.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank (default)
y/g/n> n
Edit advanced config? (y/n)
y) Yes
n) No (default)
y/n> n
Remote config
Two-factor authentication is not enabled on this account.
--------------------
[seafile]
type = seafile
url = http://my.seafile.server/
user = me@example.com
pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
2fa = false
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `seafile`. It's pointing to the root of your seafile server and can now be used like this:

See all libraries

    rclone lsd seafile:

Create a new library

    rclone mkdir seafile:library

List the contents of a library

    rclone ls seafile:library

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote library, deleting any
excess files in the library.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory seafile:library

### Configuration in library mode

Here's an example of a configuration in library mode with a user that has the two-factor authentication enabled. Your 2FA code will be asked at the end of the configuration, and will attempt to authenticate you:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> seafile
Type of storage to configure.
Enter a string value. Press Enter for the default ("").

You'll notice your password is blank in the configuration. It's because we only need the password to authenticate you once.

You specified `My Library` during the configuration. The root of the remote is pointing at the
root of the library `My Library`:

See all files in the library:

    rclone lsd seafile:

Create a new directory inside the library

    rclone mkdir seafile:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls seafile:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote library, deleting any
excess files in the library.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory seafile:


### --fast-list

Seafile version 7+ supports `--fast-list` which allows you to use fewer
transactions in exchange for more memory. See the [rclone
docs](https://rclone.org/docs/#fast-list) for more details.
Please note this is not supported on seafile server version 6.x


### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| /         | 0x2F  | ／          |
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Seafile and rclone link

Rclone supports generating share links for non-encrypted libraries only.
They can either be for a file or a directory:

```
rclone link seafile:seafile-tutorial.doc
http://my.seafile.server/f/fdcd8a2f93f84b8b90f4/

```

or if run on a directory you will get:

```
rclone link seafile:dir
http://my.seafile.server/d/9ea2455f6f55478bbb0d/
```

Please note a share link is unique for each file or directory. If you run a link command on a file/dir
that has already been shared, you will get the exact same link.

### Compatibility

It has been actively tested using the [seafile docker image](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile-docker) of these versions:
- 6.3.4 community edition
- 7.0.5 community edition
- 7.1.3 community edition

Versions below 6.0 are not supported.
Versions between 6.0 and 6.3 haven't been tested and might not work properly.

#  SFTP

SFTP is the [Secure (or SSH) File Transfer
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol).

The SFTP backend can be used with a number of different providers:


- C14
- rsync.net


SFTP runs over SSH v2 and is installed as standard with most modern
SSH installations.

Paths are specified as `remote:path`. If the path does not begin with
a `/` it is relative to the home directory of the user.  An empty path
`remote:` refers to the user's home directory. For example, `rclone lsd remote:` 
would list the home directory of the user cofigured in the rclone remote config 
(`i.e /home/sftpuser`). However, `rclone lsd remote:/` would list the root 
directory for remote machine (i.e. `/`)

Note that some SFTP servers will need the leading / - Synology is a
good example of this. rsync.net, on the other hand, requires users to
OMIT the leading /.

## Configuration

Here is an example of making an SFTP configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

SSH port, leave blank to use default (22)
port>
SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> n

Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
port =
pass =
key_file =
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this:

See all directories in the home directory

    rclone lsd remote:

See all directories in the root directory

    rclone lsd remote:/

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:path/to/directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:path/to/directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote directory, deleting any
excess files in the directory.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Mount the remote path `/srv/www-data/` to the local path
`/mnt/www-data`

    rclone mount remote:/srv/www-data/ /mnt/www-data

### SSH Authentication

The SFTP remote supports three authentication methods:

  * Password
  * Key file, including certificate signed keys
  * ssh-agent

Key files should be PEM-encoded private key files. For instance `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa`.
Only unencrypted OpenSSH or PEM encrypted files are supported.

The key file can be specified in either an external file (key_file) or contained within the 
rclone config file (key_pem).  If using key_pem in the config file, the entry should be on a
single line with new line ('\n' or '\r\n') separating lines.  i.e.

    key_pem = -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMaMbaIXtE\n0gAMbMbaSsd\nMbaass\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

This will generate it correctly for key_pem for use in the config:

    awk '{printf "%s\\n", $0}' < ~/.ssh/id_rsa

If you don't specify `pass`, `key_file`, or `key_pem` or `ask_password` then
rclone will attempt to contact an ssh-agent. You can also specify `key_use_agent`
to force the usage of an ssh-agent. In this case `key_file` or `key_pem` can
also be specified to force the usage of a specific key in the ssh-agent.

Using an ssh-agent is the only way to load encrypted OpenSSH keys at the moment.

If you set the `ask_password` option, rclone will prompt for a password when
needed and no password has been configured.

#### Certificate-signed keys

With traditional key-based authentication, you configure your private key only,
and the public key built into it will be used during the authentication process.

If you have a certificate you may use it to sign your public key, creating a
separate SSH user certificate that should be used instead of the plain public key
extracted from the private key. Then you must provide the path to the
user certificate public key file in `pubkey_file`.

Note: This is not the traditional public key paired with your private key,
typically saved as `/home/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Setting this path in
`pubkey_file` will not work.

Example:

```
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
key_file = ~/id_rsa
pubkey_file = ~/id_rsa-cert.pub
````

If you concatenate a cert with a private key then you can specify the
merged file in both places.

Note: the cert must come first in the file.  e.g.

```
cat id_rsa-cert.pub id_rsa > merged_key
```

### Host key validation

By default rclone will not check the server's host key for validation.  This
can allow an attacker to replace a server with their own and if you use
password authentication then this can lead to that password being exposed.

Host key matching, using standard `known_hosts` files can be turned on by
enabling the `known_hosts_file` option.  This can point to the file maintained
by `OpenSSH` or can point to a unique file.

e.g.

```
[remote]
type = sftp
host = example.com
user = sftpuser
pass = 
known_hosts_file = ~/.ssh/known_hosts
````

There are some limitations:

* `rclone` will not _manage_ this file for you.  If the key is missing or
wrong then the connection will be refused.
* If the server is set up for a certificate host key then the entry in
the `known_hosts` file _must_ be the `@cert-authority` entry for the CA
* Unlike `OpenSSH`, the libraries used by `rclone` do not permit (at time
of writing) multiple host keys to be listed for a server.  Only the first
entry is used.

If the host key provided by the server does not match the one in the
file (or is missing) then the connection will be aborted and an error
returned such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key mismatch

or

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown

If you see an error such as

    NewFs: couldn't connect SSH: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: no authorities for hostname: example.com:22

then it is likely the server has presented a CA signed host certificate
and you will need to add the appropriate `@cert-authority` entry.

The `known_hosts_file` setting can be set during `rclone config` as an
advanced option.

### ssh-agent on macOS

Note that there seem to be various problems with using an ssh-agent on
macOS due to recent changes in the OS.  The most effective work-around
seems to be to start an ssh-agent in each session, e.g.

    eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add -A

And then at the end of the session

    eval `ssh-agent -k`

These commands can be used in scripts of course.

### Modified time

Modified times are stored on the server to 1 second precision.

Modified times are used in syncing and are fully supported.

Some SFTP servers disable setting/modifying the file modification time after
upload (for example, certain configurations of ProFTPd with mod_sftp). If you
are using one of these servers, you can set the option `set_modtime = false` in
your RClone backend configuration to disable this behaviour.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP Connection).

#### --sftp-host

SSH host to connect to.

E.g. "example.com".

- Config:      host

SSH password, leave blank to use ssh-agent.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PASS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-key-pem

Raw PEM-encoded private key.

If specified, will override key_file parameter.

- Config:      key_pem
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_PEM
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-key-file

Path to PEM-encoded private key file.

Leave blank or set key-use-agent to use ssh-agent.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

- Config:      key_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-key-file-pass

The passphrase to decrypt the PEM-encoded private key file.

Only PEM encrypted key files (old OpenSSH format) are supported. Encrypted keys
in the new OpenSSH format can't be used.

**NB** Input to this must be obscured - see [rclone obscure](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_obscure/).

- Config:      key_file_pass
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_FILE_PASS
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-pubkey-file

Optional path to public key file.

Set this if you have a signed certificate you want to use for authentication.

- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-key-use-agent

When set forces the usage of the ssh-agent.

When key-file is also set, the ".pub" file of the specified key-file is read and only the associated key is
requested from the ssh-agent. This allows to avoid `Too many authentication failures for *username*` errors
when the ssh-agent contains many keys.

- Config:      key_use_agent
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KEY_USE_AGENT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-use-insecure-cipher

Enable the use of insecure ciphers and key exchange methods. 

This enables the use of the following insecure ciphers and key exchange methods:

- aes128-cbc
- aes192-cbc
- aes256-cbc
- 3des-cbc
- diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
- diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1

Those algorithms are insecure and may allow plaintext data to be recovered by an attacker.

- Config:      use_insecure_cipher
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_INSECURE_CIPHER
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false
- Examples:
    - "false"
        - Use default Cipher list.
    - "true"
        - Enables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher and diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 key exchange.

#### --sftp-disable-hashcheck

Disable the execution of SSH commands to determine if remote file hashing is available.

- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_HASHCHECK
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to sftp (SSH/SFTP Connection).

#### --sftp-known-hosts-file

Optional path to known_hosts file.

Set this value to enable server host key validation.

Leading `~` will be expanded in the file name as will environment variables such as `${RCLONE_CONFIG_DIR}`.

- Config:      known_hosts_file
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "~/.ssh/known_hosts"
        - Use OpenSSH's known_hosts file.

#### --sftp-ask-password

Allow asking for SFTP password when needed.

If this is set and no password is supplied then rclone will:
- ask for a password
- not contact the ssh agent


- Config:      ask_password
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_ASK_PASSWORD
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-path-override

Override path used by SSH connection.

This allows checksum calculation when SFTP and SSH paths are
different. This issue affects among others Synology NAS boxes.

Shared folders can be found in directories representing volumes

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/directory --ssh-path-override /volume2/directory

Home directory can be found in a shared folder called "home"

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:/home/directory --ssh-path-override /volume1/homes/USER/directory

- Config:      path_override
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_PATH_OVERRIDE
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-set-modtime

Set the modified time on the remote if set.

- Config:      set_modtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SET_MODTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     true

#### --sftp-md5sum-command

The command used to read md5 hashes.

Leave blank for autodetect.

- Config:      md5sum_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_MD5SUM_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-sha1sum-command

The command used to read sha1 hashes.

Leave blank for autodetect.

- Config:      sha1sum_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SHA1SUM_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-skip-links

Set to skip any symlinks and any other non regular files.

- Config:      skip_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SKIP_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-subsystem

Specifies the SSH2 subsystem on the remote host.

- Config:      subsystem
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SUBSYSTEM
- Type:        string
- Default:     "sftp"

#### --sftp-server-command

Specifies the path or command to run a sftp server on the remote host.

The subsystem option is ignored when server_command is defined.

- Config:      server_command
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_SERVER_COMMAND
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

#### --sftp-use-fstat

If set use fstat instead of stat.

Some servers limit the amount of open files and calling Stat after opening
the file will throw an error from the server. Setting this flag will call
Fstat instead of Stat which is called on an already open file handle.

It has been found that this helps with IBM Sterling SFTP servers which have
"extractability" level set to 1 which means only 1 file can be opened at
any given time.


- Config:      use_fstat
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_USE_FSTAT
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-disable-concurrent-reads

If set don't use concurrent reads.

Normally concurrent reads are safe to use and not using them will
degrade performance, so this option is disabled by default.

Some servers limit the amount number of times a file can be
downloaded. Using concurrent reads can trigger this limit, so if you
have a server which returns

    Failed to copy: file does not exist

Then you may need to enable this flag.

If concurrent reads are disabled, the use_fstat option is ignored.


- Config:      disable_concurrent_reads
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_READS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-disable-concurrent-writes

If set don't use concurrent writes.

Normally rclone uses concurrent writes to upload files. This improves
the performance greatly, especially for distant servers.

This option disables concurrent writes should that be necessary.


- Config:      disable_concurrent_writes
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_DISABLE_CONCURRENT_WRITES
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --sftp-idle-timeout

Max time before closing idle connections.

If no connections have been returned to the connection pool in the time
given, rclone will empty the connection pool.

Set to 0 to keep connections indefinitely.


- Config:      idle_timeout
- Env Var:     RCLONE_SFTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT
- Type:        Duration
- Default:     1m0s



## Limitations

SFTP supports checksums if the same login has shell access and `md5sum`
or `sha1sum` as well as `echo` are in the remote's PATH.
This remote checksumming (file hashing) is recommended and enabled by default.
Disabling the checksumming may be required if you are connecting to SFTP servers
which are not under your control, and to which the execution of remote commands
is prohibited.  Set the configuration option `disable_hashcheck` to `true` to
disable checksumming.

SFTP also supports `about` if the same login has shell
access and `df` are in the remote's PATH. `about` will
return the total space, free space, and used space on the remote
for the disk of the specified path on the remote or, if not set,
the disk of the root on the remote.
`about` will fail if it does not have shell
access or if `df` is not in the remote's PATH.

Note that some SFTP servers (e.g. Synology) the paths are different for
SSH and SFTP so the hashes can't be calculated properly.  For them
using `disable_hashcheck` is a good idea.

The only ssh agent supported under Windows is Putty's pageant.

The Go SSH library disables the use of the aes128-cbc cipher by
default, due to security concerns. This can be re-enabled on a
per-connection basis by setting the `use_insecure_cipher` setting in
the configuration file to `true`. Further details on the insecurity of
this cipher can be found
[in this paper](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf).

SFTP isn't supported under plan9 until [this
issue](https://github.com/pkg/sftp/issues/156) is fixed.

Note that since SFTP isn't HTTP based the following flags don't work
with it: `--dump-headers`, `--dump-bodies`, `--dump-auth`

Note that `--timeout` isn't supported (but `--contimeout` is).


## C14 {#c14}

C14 is supported through the SFTP backend.

See [C14's documentation](https://www.online.net/en/storage/c14-cold-storage)

## rsync.net {#rsync-net}

rsync.net is supported through the SFTP backend.

See [rsync.net's documentation of rclone examples](https://www.rsync.net/products/rclone.html).

#  SugarSync

[SugarSync](https://sugarsync.com) is a cloud service that enables
active synchronization of files across computers and other devices for
file backup, access, syncing, and sharing.

## Configuration

The initial setup for SugarSync involves getting a token from SugarSync which you
can do with rclone. `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

refresh_token = https://api.sugarsync.com/app-authorization/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Note that the config asks for your email and password but doesn't
store them, it only uses them to get the initial token.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories (sync folders) in top level of your SugarSync

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your SugarSync folder "Test"

    rclone ls remote:Test

To copy a local directory to an SugarSync folder called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

**NB** you can't create files in the top level folder you have to
create a folder, which rclone will create as a "Sync Folder" with
SugarSync.

### Modified time and hashes

SugarSync does not support modification times or hashes, therefore
syncing will default to `--size-only` checking.  Note that using
`--update` will work as rclone can read the time files were uploaded.

### Restricted filename characters

SugarSync replaces the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
except for DEL.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.

### Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the "Deleted items" folder by default.

However you can supply the flag `--sugarsync-hard-delete` or set the
config parameter `hard_delete = true` if you would like files to be
deleted straight away.

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the SugarSync backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

#  Tardigrade

[Tardigrade](https://tardigrade.io) is an encrypted, secure, and 
cost-effective object storage service that enables you to store, back up, and 
archive large amounts of data in a decentralized manner.

## Configuration

To make a new Tardigrade configuration you need one of the following:
* Access Grant that someone else shared with you.
* [API Key](https://documentation.tardigrade.io/getting-started/uploading-your-first-object/create-an-api-key)
of a Tardigrade project you are a member of.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

## Usage

Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` (or `remote:` for the `lsf`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, e.g. `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this.

### Create a new bucket

Use the `mkdir` command to create new bucket, e.g. `bucket`.

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

### List all buckets

Use the `lsf` command to list all buckets.

    rclone lsf remote:

Note the colon (`:`) character at the end of the command line.

### Delete a bucket

Use the `rmdir` command to delete an empty bucket.

    rclone rmdir remote:bucket

Use the `purge` command to delete a non-empty bucket with all its content.

    rclone purge remote:bucket

### Upload objects

Use the `copy` command to upload an object.

    rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/file.ext remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
Remove it if you don't need this information.

Use a folder in the local path to upload all its objects.

    rclone copy --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Only modified files will be copied.

### List objects

Use the `ls` command to list recursively all objects in a bucket.

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Add the folder to the remote path to list recursively all objects in this folder.

    rclone ls remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

Use the `lsf` command to list non-recursively all objects in a bucket or a folder.

    rclone lsf remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

### Download objects

Use the `copy` command to download an object.

    rclone copy --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/file.ext /home/local/directory/

The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
Remove it if you don't need this information.

Use a folder in the remote path to download all its objects.

    rclone copy --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/

### Delete objects

Use the `deletefile` command to delete a single object.

    rclone deletefile remote:bucket/path/to/dir/file.ext

Use the `delete` command to delete all object in a folder.

    rclone delete remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

### Print the total size of objects

Use the `size` command to print the total size of objects in a bucket or a folder.

    rclone size remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

### Sync two Locations

Use the `sync` command to sync the source to the destination,
changing the destination only, deleting any excess files.

    rclone sync -i --progress /home/local/directory/ remote:bucket/path/to/dir/

The `--progress` flag is for displaying progress information.
Remove it if you don't need this information.

Since this can cause data loss, test first with the `--dry-run` flag
to see exactly what would be copied and deleted.

The sync can be done also from Tardigrade to the local file system.

    rclone sync -i --progress remote:bucket/path/to/dir/ /home/local/directory/

Or between two Tardigrade buckets.

    rclone sync -i --progress remote-us:bucket/path/to/dir/ remote-europe:bucket/path/to/dir/

Or even between another cloud storage and Tardigrade.

    rclone sync -i --progress s3:bucket/path/to/dir/ tardigrade:bucket/path/to/dir/

## Limitations

`rclone about` is not supported by the rclone Tardigrade backend. Backends without
this capability cannot determine free space for an rclone mount or
use policy `mfs` (most free space) as a member of an rclone union
remote.

See [List of backends that do not support rclone about](https://rclone.org/overview/#optional-features)
See [rclone about](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_about/)

## Known issues

If you get errors like `too many open files` this usually happens when the default `ulimit` for system max open files is exceeded. Native Storj protocol opens a large number of TCP connections (each of which is counted as an open file). For a single upload stream you can expect 110 TCP connections to be opened. For a single download stream you can expect 35. This batch of connections will be opened for every 64 MiB segment and you should also expect TCP connections to be reused. If you do many transfers you eventually open a connection to most storage nodes (thousands of nodes).

To fix these, please raise your system limits. You can do this issuing a `ulimit -n 65536` just before you run rclone. To change the limits more permanently you can add this to your shell startup script, e.g. `$HOME/.bashrc`, or change the system-wide configuration, usually `/etc/sysctl.conf` and/or `/etc/security/limits.conf`, but please refer to your operating system manual.

#  Uptobox

This is a Backend for Uptobox file storage service. Uptobox is closer to a one-click hoster than a traditional 
cloud storage provider and therefore not suitable for long term storage. 

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

To configure an Uptobox backend you'll need your personal api token. You'll find it in your
[account settings](https://uptobox.com/my_account)

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote` with the default setup.  First run:

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
TestUptobox          uptobox

[uptobox]
type = uptobox
api_key = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK (default)
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> 
```
Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your Uptobox

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your Uptobox

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an Uptobox directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes

Uptobox supports neither modified times nor checksums.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| "         | 0x22  | ＂          |
| `         | 0x41  | ｀          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in XML strings.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).

#### --uptobox-access-token

Your access token.

Get it from https://uptobox.com/my_account.

- Config:      access_token
- Env Var:     RCLONE_UPTOBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""

### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to uptobox (Uptobox).

#### --uptobox-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_UPTOBOX_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,LtGt,DoubleQuote,BackQuote,Del,Ctl,LeftSpace,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

Uptobox will delete inactive files that have not been accessed in 60 days.

`rclone about` is not supported by this backend an overview of used space can however
been seen in the uptobox web interface.

#  Union

The `union` remote provides a unification similar to UnionFS using other remotes.

Paths may be as deep as required or a local path, 
e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory` or `/directory/subdirectory`.

During the initial setup with `rclone config` you will specify the upstream
remotes as a space separated list. The upstream remotes can either be a local paths or other remotes.

Attribute `:ro` and `:nc` can be attach to the end of path to tag the remote as **read only** or **no create**,
e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory:ro` or `remote:directory/subdirectory:nc`.

Subfolders can be used in upstream remotes. Assume a union remote named `backup`
with the remotes `mydrive:private/backup`. Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:desktop`
is exactly the same as invoking `rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/desktop`.

There will be no special handling of paths containing `..` segments.
Invoking `rclone mkdir backup:../desktop` is exactly the same as invoking
`rclone mkdir mydrive:private/backup/../desktop`.

## Configuration

Here is an example of how to make a union called `remote` for local folders.
First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n

Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
type = union
upstreams = remote1:dir1 remote2:dir2 remote3:dir3
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
Current remotes:

Name                 Type
====                 ====
remote               union

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote
d) Delete remote
r) Rename remote
c) Copy remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
e/n/d/r/c/s/q> q
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level in `remote1:dir1`, `remote2:dir2` and `remote3:dir3`

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in `remote1:dir1`, `remote2:dir2` and `remote3:dir3`

    rclone ls remote:

Copy another local directory to the union directory called source, which will be placed into `remote3:dir3`

    rclone copy C:\source remote:source

### Behavior / Policies

The behavior of union backend is inspired by [trapexit/mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs). All functions are grouped into 3 categories: **action**, **create** and **search**. These functions and categories can be assigned a policy which dictates what file or directory is chosen when performing that behavior. Any policy can be assigned to a function or category though some may not be very useful in practice. For instance: **rand** (random) may be useful for file creation (create) but could lead to very odd behavior if used for `delete` if there were more than one copy of the file.

### Function / Category classifications

| Category | Description              | Functions                                                                           |
|----------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| action   | Writing Existing file    | move, rmdir, rmdirs, delete, purge and copy, sync (as destination when file exist)  |
| create   | Create non-existing file | copy, sync (as destination when file not exist)                                     |
| search   | Reading and listing file | ls, lsd, lsl, cat, md5sum, sha1sum and copy, sync (as source)                       |
| N/A      |                          | size, about                                                                         |

### Path Preservation

Policies, as described below, are of two basic types. `path preserving` and `non-path preserving`.

All policies which start with `ep` (**epff**, **eplfs**, **eplus**, **epmfs**, **eprand**) are `path preserving`. `ep` stands for `existing path`.

A path preserving policy will only consider upstreams where the relative path being accessed already exists.

When using non-path preserving policies paths will be created in target upstreams as necessary.

### Quota Relevant Policies

Some policies rely on quota information. These policies should be used only if your upstreams support the respective quota fields.

| Policy     | Required Field |
|------------|----------------|
| lfs, eplfs | Free           |
| mfs, epmfs | Free           |
| lus, eplus | Used           |
| lno, eplno | Objects        |

To check if your upstream supports the field, run `rclone about remote: [flags]` and see if the required field exists.

### Filters

Policies basically search upstream remotes and create a list of files / paths for functions to work on. The policy is responsible for filtering and sorting. The policy type defines the sorting but filtering is mostly uniform as described below.

* No **search** policies filter.
* All **action** policies will filter out remotes which are tagged as **read-only**.
* All **create** policies will filter out remotes which are tagged **read-only** or **no-create**.

If all remotes are filtered an error will be returned.

### Policy descriptions

The policies definition are inspired by [trapexit/mergerfs](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs) but not exactly the same. Some policy definition could be different due to the much larger latency of remote file systems.

| Policy           | Description                                                |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| all | Search category: same as **epall**. Action category: same as **epall**. Create category: act on all upstreams. |
| epall (existing path, all) | Search category: Given this order configured, act on the first one found where the relative path exists. Action category: apply to all found. Create category: act on all upstreams where the relative path exists. |
| epff (existing path, first found) | Act on the first one found, by the time upstreams reply, where the relative path exists. |
| eplfs (existing path, least free space) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the least free space. |
| eplus (existing path, least used space) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the least used space. |
| eplno (existing path, least number of objects) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the least number of objects. |
| epmfs (existing path, most free space) | Of all the upstreams on which the relative path exists choose the one with the most free space. |
| eprand (existing path, random) | Calls **epall** and then randomizes. Returns only one upstream. |
| ff (first found) | Search category: same as **epff**. Action category: same as **epff**. Create category: Act on the first one found by the time upstreams reply. |
| lfs (least free space) | Search category: same as **eplfs**. Action category: same as **eplfs**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the least available free space. |
| lus (least used space) | Search category: same as **eplus**. Action category: same as **eplus**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the least used space. |
| lno (least number of objects) | Search category: same as **eplno**. Action category: same as **eplno**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the least number of objects. |
| mfs (most free space) | Search category: same as **epmfs**. Action category: same as **epmfs**. Create category: Pick the upstream with the most available free space. |
| newest | Pick the file / directory with the largest mtime. |
| rand (random) | Calls **all** and then randomizes. Returns only one upstream. |

#  WebDAV

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

To configure the WebDAV remote you will need to have a URL for it, and
a username and password.  If you know what kind of system you are
connecting to then rclone can enable extra features.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Webdav
   \ "webdav"
[snip]
Storage> webdav
URL of http host to connect to
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Connect to example.com
   \ "https://example.com"
url> https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/
Name of the Webdav site/service/software you are using
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
 1 / Nextcloud
   \ "nextcloud"
 2 / Owncloud
   \ "owncloud"
 3 / Sharepoint Online, authenticated by Microsoft account.
   \ "sharepoint"
 4 / Sharepoint with NTLM authentication. Usually self-hosted or on-premises.
   \ "sharepoint-ntlm"
 5 / Other site/service or software
   \ "other"
vendor> 1
User name
user> user
Password.
y) Yes type in my own password
g) Generate random password
n) No leave this optional password blank
y/g/n> y
Enter the password:
password:
Confirm the password:
password:
Bearer token instead of user/pass (e.g. a Macaroon)
bearer_token>
Remote config
--------------------
[remote]
type = webdav
url = https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/
vendor = nextcloud
user = user
pass = *** ENCRYPTED ***
bearer_token =
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your WebDAV

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your WebDAV

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an WebDAV directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes ###

Plain WebDAV does not support modified times.  However when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support modified times.

Likewise plain WebDAV does not support hashes, however when used with
Owncloud or Nextcloud rclone will support SHA1 and MD5 hashes.
Depending on the exact version of Owncloud or Nextcloud hashes may
appear on all objects, or only on objects which had a hash uploaded
with them.


### Standard options

Here are the standard options specific to webdav (Webdav).

- Env Var:     RCLONE_WEBDAV_HEADERS
- Type:        CommaSepList
- Default:     



## Provider notes

See below for notes on specific providers.

### Owncloud

Click on the settings cog in the bottom right of the page and this
will show the WebDAV URL that rclone needs in the config step.  It
will look something like `https://example.com/remote.php/webdav/`.

Owncloud supports modified times using the `X-OC-Mtime` header.

### Nextcloud

This is configured in an identical way to Owncloud.  Note that
Nextcloud initially did not support streaming of files (`rcat`) whereas
Owncloud did, but [this](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/issues/365) seems to be fixed as of 2020-11-27 (tested with rclone v1.53.1 and Nextcloud Server v19).

### Sharepoint Online

Rclone can be used with Sharepoint provided by OneDrive for Business
or Office365 Education Accounts.
This feature is only needed for a few of these Accounts,
mostly Office365 Education ones. These accounts are sometimes not
verified by the domain owner [github#1975](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/1975)

This means that these accounts can't be added using the official
API (other Accounts should work with the "onedrive" option). However,
it is possible to access them using webdav.

To use a sharepoint remote with rclone, add it like this:
First, you need to get your remote's URL:

- Go [here](https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/)
  to open your OneDrive or to sign in
- Now take a look at your address bar, the URL should look like this:
  `https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx`

You'll only need this URL up to the email address. After that, you'll
most likely want to add "/Documents". That subdirectory contains
the actual data stored on your OneDrive.

Add the remote to rclone like this:
Configure the `url` as `https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents`
and use your normal account email and password for `user` and `pass`.
If you have 2FA enabled, you have to generate an app password.
Set the `vendor` to `sharepoint`.

Your config file should look like this:

```
[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]-my.sharepoint.com/personal/[YOUR-EMAIL]/Documents
vendor = sharepoint
user = YourEmailAddress
pass = encryptedpassword
```

### Sharepoint with NTLM Authentication

Use this option in case your (hosted) Sharepoint is not tied to OneDrive accounts and uses NTLM authentication.

To get the `url` configuration, similarly to the above, first navigate to the desired directory in your browser to get the URL,
then strip everything after the name of the opened directory.

Example:
If the URL is:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx

The configuration to use would be:
https://example.sharepoint.com/sites/12345/Documents

Set the `vendor` to `sharepoint-ntlm`.

NTLM uses domain and user name combination for authentication,
set `user` to `DOMAIN\username`.

Your config file should look like this:

```
[sharepoint]
type = webdav
url = https://[YOUR-DOMAIN]/some-path-to/Documents
vendor = sharepoint-ntlm
user = DOMAIN\user
pass = encryptedpassword
```

#### Required Flags for SharePoint

As SharePoint does some special things with uploaded documents, you won't be able to use the documents size or the documents hash to compare if a file has been changed since the upload / which file is newer.

For Rclone calls copying files (especially Office files such as .docx, .xlsx, etc.) from/to SharePoint (like copy, sync, etc.), you should append these flags to ensure Rclone uses the "Last Modified" datetime property to compare your documents:

```
--ignore-size --ignore-checksum --update
```

### dCache

dCache is a storage system that supports many protocols and
authentication/authorisation schemes.  For WebDAV clients, it allows
users to authenticate with username and password (BASIC), X.509,
Kerberos, and various bearer tokens, including
[Macaroons](https://www.dcache.org/manuals/workshop-2017-05-29-Umea/000-Final/anupam_macaroons_v02.pdf)
and [OpenID-Connect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect)
access tokens.

Configure as normal using the `other` type.  Don't enter a username or
password, instead enter your Macaroon as the `bearer_token`.

The config will end up looking something like this.

```
[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache...
vendor = other
user =
pass =
bearer_token = your-macaroon
```

There is a [script](https://github.com/sara-nl/GridScripts/blob/master/get-macaroon) that
obtains a Macaroon from a dCache WebDAV endpoint, and creates an rclone config file.

Macaroons may also be obtained from the dCacheView
web-browser/JavaScript client that comes with dCache.

### OpenID-Connect

dCache also supports authenticating with OpenID-Connect access tokens.
OpenID-Connect is a protocol (based on OAuth 2.0) that allows services
to identify users who have authenticated with some central service.

Support for OpenID-Connect in rclone is currently achieved using
another software package called
[oidc-agent](https://github.com/indigo-dc/oidc-agent).  This is a
command-line tool that facilitates obtaining an access token.  Once
installed and configured, an access token is obtained by running the
`oidc-token` command.  The following example shows a (shortened)
access token obtained from the *XDC* OIDC Provider.

```
paul@celebrimbor:~$ oidc-token XDC
eyJraWQ[...]QFXDt0
paul@celebrimbor:~$
```

**Note** Before the `oidc-token` command will work, the refresh token
must be loaded into the oidc agent.  This is done with the `oidc-add`
command (e.g., `oidc-add XDC`).  This is typically done once per login
session.  Full details on this and how to register oidc-agent with
your OIDC Provider are provided in the [oidc-agent
documentation](https://indigo-dc.gitbooks.io/oidc-agent/).

The rclone `bearer_token_command` configuration option is used to
fetch the access token from oidc-agent.

Configure as a normal WebDAV endpoint, using the 'other' vendor,
leaving the username and password empty.  When prompted, choose to
edit the advanced config and enter the command to get a bearer token
(e.g., `oidc-agent XDC`).

The following example config shows a WebDAV endpoint that uses
oidc-agent to supply an access token from the *XDC* OIDC Provider.

```
[dcache]
type = webdav
url = https://dcache.example.org/
vendor = other
bearer_token_command = oidc-token XDC
```

# Yandex Disk

[Yandex Disk](https://disk.yandex.com) is a cloud storage solution created by [Yandex](https://yandex.com).

## Configuration

Here is an example of making a yandex configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
n/s> n

 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
client_id =
client_secret =

--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from Yandex Disk. This only runs from the moment it
opens your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.
This is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to
unblock it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Yandex paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modified time

Modified times are supported and are stored accurate to 1 ns in custom
metadata called `rclone_modified` in RFC3339 with nanoseconds format.

### MD5 checksums

MD5 checksums are natively supported by Yandex Disk.

### Emptying Trash

If you wish to empty your trash you can use the `rclone cleanup remote:`
command which will permanently delete all your trashed files. This command
does not take any path arguments.

### Quota information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your usage limit (quota) and the current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

The [default restricted characters set](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-characters)
are replaced.

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,Del,Ctl,InvalidUtf8,Dot



## Limitations

When uploading very large files (bigger than about 5 GiB) you will need
to increase the `--timeout` parameter.  This is because Yandex pauses
(perhaps to calculate the MD5SUM for the entire file) before returning
confirmation that the file has been uploaded.  The default handling of
timeouts in rclone is to assume a 5 minute pause is an error and close
the connection - you'll see `net/http: timeout awaiting response
headers` errors in the logs if this is happening.  Setting the timeout
to twice the max size of file in GiB should be enough, so if you want
to upload a 30 GiB file set a timeout of `2 * 30 = 60m`, that is
`--timeout 60m`.

Having a Yandex Mail account is mandatory to use the Yandex.Disk subscription.
Token generation will work without a mail account, but Rclone won't be able to complete any actions.

```

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Rclone runs a webserver on your local computer to collect the
authorization token from Zoho Workdrive. This is only from the moment
your browser is opened until the token is returned.
The webserver runs on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`.
If local port `53682` is protected by a firewall you may need to temporarily
unblock the firewall to complete authorization.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Zoho paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modified time

Modified times are currently not supported for Zoho Workdrive

### Checksums

No checksums are supported.

### Usage information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
command which will display your current usage.

### Restricted filename characters

Only control characters and invalid UTF-8 are replaced. In addition most
Unicode full-width characters are not supported at all and will be removed 
from filenames during upload.

#  Local Filesystem

Local paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, e.g. `/path/to/wherever`, so

    rclone sync -i /home/source /tmp/destination

Will sync `/home/source` to `/tmp/destination`.

## Configuration

For consistencies sake one can also configure a remote of type
`local` in the config file, and access the local filesystem using
rclone remote paths, e.g. `remote:path/to/wherever`, but it is probably
easier not to.

### Modified time ###

Rclone reads and writes the modified time using an accuracy determined by
the OS. Typically this is 1ns on Linux, 10 ns on Windows and 1 Second
on OS X.

### Filenames ###

Filenames should be encoded in UTF-8 on disk. This is the normal case
for Windows and OS X.

There is a bit more uncertainty in the Linux world, but new
distributions will have UTF-8 encoded files names. If you are using an
old Linux filesystem with non UTF-8 file names (e.g. latin1) then you
can use the `convmv` tool to convert the filesystem to UTF-8. This
tool is available in most distributions' package managers.

If an invalid (non-UTF8) filename is read, the invalid characters will
be replaced with a quoted representation of the invalid bytes. The name
`gro\xdf` will be transferred as `gro‛DF`. `rclone` will emit a debug
message in this case (use `-v` to see), e.g.

```
Local file system at .: Replacing invalid UTF-8 characters in "gro\xdf"
```

#### Restricted characters

With the local backend, restrictions on the characters that are usable in
file or directory names depend on the operating system. To check what
rclone will replace by default on your system, run `rclone help flags local-encoding`.

On non Windows platforms the following characters are replaced when
handling file names.

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |
| /         | 0x2F  | ／           |

When running on Windows the following characters are replaced. This
list is based on the [Windows file naming conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions).

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| NUL       | 0x00  | ␀           |

| \         | 0x5C  | ＼           |
| \|        | 0x7C  | ｜           |

File names on Windows can also not end with the following characters.
These only get replaced if they are the last character in the name:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| SP        | 0x20  | ␠           |
| .         | 0x2E  | ．           |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](https://rclone.org/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be converted to UTF-16.

### Paths on Windows ###

On Windows there are many ways of specifying a path to a file system resource.
Local paths can be absolute, like `C:\path\to\wherever`, or relative,
like `..\wherever`. Network paths in UNC format, `\\server\share`, are also supported.
Path separator can be either `\` (as in `C:\path\to\wherever`) or `/` (as in `C:/path/to/wherever`).
Length of these paths are limited to 259 characters for files and 247
characters for directories, but there is an alternative extended-length
path format increasing the limit to (approximately) 32,767 characters.
This format requires absolute paths and the use of prefix `\\?\`,
e.g. `\\?\D:\some\very\long\path`. For convenience rclone will automatically
convert regular paths into the corresponding extended-length paths,
so in most cases you do not have to worry about this (read more [below](#long-paths)).

Note that Windows supports using the same prefix `\\?\` to
specify path to volumes identified by their GUID, e.g.
`\\?\Volume{b75e2c83-0000-0000-0000-602f00000000}\some\path`.
This is *not* supported in rclone, due to an [issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39785)
in go.

#### Long paths ####

Rclone handles long paths automatically, by converting all paths to
[extended-length path format](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation), which allows paths up to 32,767 characters.

This conversion will ensure paths are absolute and prefix them with
the `\\?\`. This is why you will see that your paths, for instance
`.\files` is shown as path `\\?\C:\files` in the output, and `\\server\share`
as `\\?\UNC\server\share`.

However, in rare cases this may cause problems with buggy file
system drivers like [EncFS](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/261).
To disable UNC conversion globally, add this to your `.rclone.conf` file:

```
[local]
nounc = true
```

If you want to selectively disable UNC, you can add it to a separate entry like this:

```
[nounc]
type = local
nounc = true
```
And use rclone like this:

`rclone copy c:\src nounc:z:\dst`

This will use UNC paths on `c:\src` but not on `z:\dst`.
Of course this will cause problems if the absolute path length of a
file exceeds 259 characters on z, so only use this option if you have to.

### Symlinks / Junction points

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply `--copy-links` or `-L` then rclone will follow the
symlink and copy the pointed to file or directory.  Note that this
flag is incompatible with `--links` / `-l`.

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

```
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├── b -> ../b
├── expected -> ../expected
├── one
└── two
    └── three
```

Then you can see the difference with and without the flag like this

```
$ rclone ls /tmp/a
        6 one
        6 two/three
```

and

```
$ rclone -L ls /tmp/a
     4174 expected
        6 one
        6 two/three
        6 b/two
        6 b/one
```

#### --links, -l 

Normally rclone will ignore symlinks or junction points (which behave
like symlinks under Windows).

If you supply this flag then rclone will copy symbolic links from the local storage,
and store them as text files, with a '.rclonelink' suffix in the remote storage.

The text file will contain the target of the symbolic link (see example).

This flag applies to all commands.

For example, supposing you have a directory structure like this

```
$ tree /tmp/a
/tmp/a
├── file1 -> ./file4
└── file2 -> /home/user/file3
```

Copying the entire directory with '-l'

```
$ rclone copyto -l /tmp/a/file1 remote:/tmp/a/
```

The remote files are created with a '.rclonelink' suffix

```
$ rclone ls remote:/tmp/a
       5 file1.rclonelink
      14 file2.rclonelink
```

The remote files will contain the target of the symbolic links

```
$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file1.rclonelink
./file4

$ rclone cat remote:/tmp/a/file2.rclonelink
/home/user/file3
```

Copying them back with '-l'

```
$ rclone copyto -l remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├── file1 -> ./file4
└── file2 -> /home/user/file3
```

However, if copied back without '-l'

```
$ rclone copyto remote:/tmp/a/ /tmp/b/

$ tree /tmp/b
/tmp/b
├── file1.rclonelink
└── file2.rclonelink
````

Note that this flag is incompatible with `-copy-links` / `-L`.

### Restricting filesystems with --one-file-system

Normally rclone will recurse through filesystems as mounted.

However if you set `--one-file-system` or `-x` this tells rclone to
stay in the filesystem specified by the root and not to recurse into
different file systems.

For example if you have a directory hierarchy like this

```
root
├── disk1     - disk1 mounted on the root
│   └── file3 - stored on disk1
├── disk2     - disk2 mounted on the root
│   └── file4 - stored on disk12
├── file1     - stored on the root disk
└── file2     - stored on the root disk
```

Using `rclone --one-file-system copy root remote:` will only copy `file1` and `file2`.  Eg

```
$ rclone -q --one-file-system ls root
        0 file1
        0 file2
```

```
$ rclone -q ls root
        0 disk1/file3
        0 disk2/file4
        0 file1
        0 file2
```

**NB** Rclone (like most unix tools such as `du`, `rsync` and `tar`)
treats a bind mount to the same device as being on the same
filesystem.

**NB** This flag is only available on Unix based systems.  On systems
where it isn't supported (e.g. Windows) it will be ignored.


### Advanced options

Here are the advanced options specific to local (Local Disk).

#### --local-nounc

Disable UNC (long path names) conversion on Windows.

- Config:      nounc
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NOUNC
- Type:        string
- Default:     ""
- Examples:
    - "true"
        - Disables long file names.

#### --copy-links / -L

Follow symlinks and copy the pointed to item.

- Config:      copy_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_COPY_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --links / -l

Translate symlinks to/from regular files with a '.rclonelink' extension.

- Config:      links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --skip-links

Don't warn about skipped symlinks.

This flag disables warning messages on skipped symlinks or junction
points, as you explicitly acknowledge that they should be skipped.

- Config:      skip_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_SKIP_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-zero-size-links

Assume the Stat size of links is zero (and read them instead) (deprecated).

Rclone used to use the Stat size of links as the link size, but this fails in quite a few places:

- Windows
- On some virtual filesystems (such ash LucidLink)
- Android

So rclone now always reads the link.


- Config:      zero_size_links
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_ZERO_SIZE_LINKS
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-unicode-normalization

Apply unicode NFC normalization to paths and filenames.

This flag can be used to normalize file names into unicode NFC form
that are read from the local filesystem.

Rclone does not normally touch the encoding of file names it reads from
the file system.

This can be useful when using macOS as it normally provides decomposed (NFD)
unicode which in some language (eg Korean) doesn't display properly on
some OSes.

Note that rclone compares filenames with unicode normalization in the sync
routine so this flag shouldn't normally be used.

- Config:      unicode_normalization
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_UNICODE_NORMALIZATION
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-check-updated

Don't check to see if the files change during upload.

Normally rclone checks the size and modification time of files as they
are being uploaded and aborts with a message which starts "can't copy
- source file is being updated" if the file changes during upload.

However on some file systems this modification time check may fail (e.g.
[Glusterfs #2206](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/2206)) so this
check can be disabled with this flag.

If this flag is set, rclone will use its best efforts to transfer a
file which is being updated. If the file is only having things
appended to it (e.g. a log) then rclone will transfer the log file with
the size it had the first time rclone saw it.

If the file is being modified throughout (not just appended to) then
the transfer may fail with a hash check failure.

In detail, once the file has had stat() called on it for the first
time we:

- Only transfer the size that stat gave
- Only checksum the size that stat gave
- Don't update the stat info for the file



- Config:      no_check_updated
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_CHECK_UPDATED
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --one-file-system / -x

Don't cross filesystem boundaries (unix/macOS only).

- Config:      one_file_system
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_ONE_FILE_SYSTEM
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-case-sensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case sensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else.  Use this flag
to override the default choice.

- Config:      case_sensitive
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_SENSITIVE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-case-insensitive

Force the filesystem to report itself as case insensitive.

Normally the local backend declares itself as case insensitive on
Windows/macOS and case sensitive for everything else.  Use this flag
to override the default choice.

- Config:      case_insensitive
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_CASE_INSENSITIVE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-preallocate

Disable preallocation of disk space for transferred files.

Preallocation of disk space helps prevent filesystem fragmentation.
However, some virtual filesystem layers (such as Google Drive File
Stream) may incorrectly set the actual file size equal to the
preallocated space, causing checksum and file size checks to fail.
Use this flag to disable preallocation.

- Config:      no_preallocate
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_PREALLOCATE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-sparse

Disable sparse files for multi-thread downloads.

On Windows platforms rclone will make sparse files when doing
multi-thread downloads. This avoids long pauses on large files where
the OS zeros the file. However sparse files may be undesirable as they
cause disk fragmentation and can be slow to work with.

- Config:      no_sparse
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SPARSE
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-no-set-modtime

Disable setting modtime.

Normally rclone updates modification time of files after they are done
uploading. This can cause permissions issues on Linux platforms when 
the user rclone is running as does not own the file uploaded, such as
when copying to a CIFS mount owned by another user. If this option is 
enabled, rclone will no longer update the modtime after copying a file.

- Config:      no_set_modtime
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_NO_SET_MODTIME
- Type:        bool
- Default:     false

#### --local-encoding

This sets the encoding for the backend.

See the [encoding section in the overview](https://rclone.org/overview/#encoding) for more info.

- Config:      encoding
- Env Var:     RCLONE_LOCAL_ENCODING
- Type:        MultiEncoder
- Default:     Slash,Dot

# Bugs and Limitations

## Limitations

### Directory timestamps aren't preserved

Rclone doesn't currently preserve the timestamps of directories.  This
is because rclone only really considers objects when syncing.

### Rclone struggles with millions of files in a directory/bucket

Currently rclone loads each directory/bucket entirely into memory before
using it.  Since each rclone object takes 0.5k-1k of memory this can take
a very long time and use a large amount of memory.

Millions of files in a directory tends to occur on bucket-based remotes
(e.g. S3 buckets) since those remotes do not segregate subdirectories within
the bucket.

### Bucket based remotes and folders

Bucket based remotes (e.g. S3/GCS/Swift/B2) do not have a concept of
directories.  Rclone therefore cannot create directories in them which
means that empty directories on a bucket based remote will tend to
disappear.

Some software creates empty keys ending in `/` as directory markers.
Rclone doesn't do this as it potentially creates more objects and
costs more.  This ability may be added in the future (probably via a
flag/option).

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands ###

Yes they do.  All the rclone commands (e.g. `sync`, `copy`, etc.) will
work on all the remote storage systems.

### Can I copy the config from one machine to another ###

Sure!  Rclone stores all of its config in a single file.  If you want
to find this file, run `rclone config file` which will tell you where
it is.

See the [remote setup docs](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) for more info.

### How do I configure rclone on a remote / headless box with no browser? ###

This has now been documented in its own [remote setup page](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/).

### Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3 ###

Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.

Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so
the node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.

The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).

Eg

    rclone sync -i drive:Folder s3:bucket


### Using rclone from multiple locations at the same time ###

You can use rclone from multiple places at the same time if you choose
different subdirectory for the output, e.g.

```
Server A> rclone sync -i /tmp/whatever remote:ServerA
Server B> rclone sync -i /tmp/whatever remote:ServerB
```

If you sync to the same directory then you should use rclone copy
otherwise the two instances of rclone may delete each other's files, e.g.

```
Server A> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
Server B> rclone copy /tmp/whatever remote:Backup
```

The file names you upload from Server A and Server B should be
different in this case, otherwise some file systems (e.g. Drive) may
make duplicates.

### Why doesn't rclone support partial transfers / binary diffs like rsync? ###

Rclone stores each file you transfer as a native object on the remote
cloud storage system.  This means that you can see the files you
upload as expected using alternative access methods (e.g. using the
Google Drive web interface).  There is a 1:1 mapping between files on
your hard disk and objects created in the cloud storage system.

Cloud storage systems (at least none I've come across yet) don't
support partially uploading an object. You can't take an existing
object, and change some bytes in the middle of it.

It would be possible to make a sync system which stored binary diffs
instead of whole objects like rclone does, but that would break the
1:1 mapping of files on your hard disk to objects in the remote cloud
storage system.

All the cloud storage systems support partial downloads of content, so
it would be possible to make partial downloads work.  However to make
this work efficiently this would require storing a significant amount
of metadata, which breaks the desired 1:1 mapping of files to objects.

### Can rclone do bi-directional sync? ###

No, not at present.  rclone only does uni-directional sync from A ->
B. It may do in the future though since it has all the primitives - it
just requires writing the algorithm to do it.

### Can I use rclone with an HTTP proxy? ###

Yes. rclone will follow the standard environment variables for
proxies, similar to cURL and other programs.

In general the variables are called `http_proxy` (for services reached
over `http`) and `https_proxy` (for services reached over `https`).  Most
public services will be using `https`, but you may wish to set both.

The content of the variable is `protocol://server:port`.  The protocol
value is the one used to talk to the proxy server, itself, and is commonly
either `http` or `socks5`.

Slightly annoyingly, there is no _standard_ for the name; some applications
may use `http_proxy` but another one `HTTP_PROXY`.  The `Go` libraries
used by `rclone` will try both variations, but you may wish to set all
possibilities.  So, on Linux, you may end up with code similar to

    export http_proxy=http://proxyserver:12345
    export https_proxy=$http_proxy
    export HTTP_PROXY=$http_proxy
    export HTTPS_PROXY=$http_proxy

The `NO_PROXY` allows you to disable the proxy for specific hosts.
Hosts must be comma separated, and can contain domains or parts.
For instance "foo.com" also matches "bar.foo.com".

e.g.

    export no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.0/8,my.host.name
    export NO_PROXY=$no_proxy

Note that the ftp backend does not support `ftp_proxy` yet.

### Rclone gives x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided error ###

This means that `rclone` can't find the SSL root certificates.  Likely
you are running `rclone` on a NAS with a cut-down Linux OS, or
possibly on Solaris.

Rclone (via the Go runtime) tries to load the root certificates from
these places on Linux.

    "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", // Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo etc.
    "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt",   // Fedora/RHEL
    "/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem",             // OpenSUSE
    "/etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem",            // OpenELEC

So doing something like this should fix the problem.  It also sets the
time which is important for SSL to work properly.

```
mkdir -p /etc/ssl/certs/
curl -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
ntpclient -s -h pool.ntp.org
```

The two environment variables `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `SSL_CERT_DIR`, mentioned in the [x509 package](https://godoc.org/crypto/x509),
provide an additional way to provide the SSL root certificates.

Note that you may need to add the `--insecure` option to the `curl` command line if it doesn't work without.

```
curl --insecure -o /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bagder/ca-bundle/master/ca-bundle.crt
```

### Rclone gives Failed to load config file: function not implemented error ###

Likely this means that you are running rclone on Linux version not
supported by the go runtime, ie earlier than version 2.6.23.

See the [system requirements section in the go install
docs](https://golang.org/doc/install) for full details.

### All my uploaded docx/xlsx/pptx files appear as archive/zip ###

This is caused by uploading these files from a Windows computer which
hasn't got the Microsoft Office suite installed.  The easiest way to
fix is to install the Word viewer and the Microsoft Office
Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 and later
versions' file formats

### tcp lookup some.domain.com no such host ###

This happens when rclone cannot resolve a domain. Please check that
your DNS setup is generally working, e.g.

```
# both should print a long list of possible IP addresses
dig www.googleapis.com          # resolve using your default DNS
dig www.googleapis.com @8.8.8.8 # resolve with Google's DNS server
```

If you are using `systemd-resolved` (default on Arch Linux), ensure it
is at version 233 or higher. Previous releases contain a bug which
causes not all domains to be resolved properly.

Additionally with the `GODEBUG=netdns=` environment variable the Go
resolver decision can be influenced. This also allows to resolve certain
issues with DNS resolution. See the [name resolution section in the go docs](https://golang.org/pkg/net/#hdr-Name_Resolution).

### The total size reported in the stats for a sync is wrong and keeps changing

It is likely you have more than 10,000 files that need to be
synced. By default rclone only gets 10,000 files ahead in a sync so as
not to use up too much memory. You can change this default with the
[--max-backlog](https://rclone.org/docs/#max-backlog-n) flag.

### Rclone is using too much memory or appears to have a memory leak

Rclone is written in Go which uses a garbage collector.  The default
settings for the garbage collector mean that it runs when the heap
size has doubled.

However it is possible to tune the garbage collector to use less
memory by [setting GOGC](https://dave.cheney.net/tag/gogc) to a lower
value, say `export GOGC=20`.  This will make the garbage collector
work harder, reducing memory size at the expense of CPU usage.

The most common cause of rclone using lots of memory is a single
directory with thousands or millions of files in.  Rclone has to load
this entirely into memory as rclone objects.  Each rclone object takes
0.5k-1k of memory.

### Rclone changes fullwidth Unicode punctuation marks in file names

For example: On a Windows system, you have a file with name `Test：1.jpg`,
where `：` is the Unicode fullwidth colon symbol. When using rclone
to copy this to your Google Drive, you will notice that the file
gets renamed to `Test:1.jpg`, where `:` is the regular (halfwidth) colon.

The reason for such renames is the way rclone handles different
[restricted filenames](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-filenames) on different
cloud storage systems. It tries to avoid ambiguous file names as
much and allow moving files between many cloud storage systems
transparently, by replacing invalid characters with similar looking
Unicode characters when transferring to one storage system, and replacing
back again when transferring to a different storage system where the
original characters are supported. When the same Unicode characters
are intentionally used in file names, this replacement strategy leads
to unwanted renames. Read more [here](https://rclone.org/overview/#restricted-filenames-caveats).
