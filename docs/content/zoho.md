See the [remote setup docs](/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Rclone runs a webserver on your local computer to collect the
authorization token from Zoho Workdrive. This is only from the moment
your browser is opened until the token is returned.
The webserver runs on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/`.
If local port `53682` is protected by a firewall you may need to temporarily
unblock the firewall to complete authorization.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

See top level directories

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new directory

    rclone mkdir remote:directory

List the contents of a directory

    rclone ls remote:directory

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote path, deleting any
excess files in the path.

    rclone sync -i /home/local/directory remote:directory

Zoho paths may be as deep as required, eg `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

### Modified time

Modified times are currently not supported for Zoho Workdrive

### Checksums

### Usage information

To view your current quota you can use the `rclone about remote:`
