# {{< icon "fa fa-cloud" >}} pCloud

Paths are specified as `remote:path`

Paths may be as deep as required, e.g. `remote:directory/subdirectory`.

## Configuration

The initial setup for pCloud involves getting a token from pCloud which you
need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you through it.

Here is an example of how to make a remote called `remote`.  First run:

     rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process:

```
No remotes found - make a new one
n) New remote
s) Set configuration password
q) Quit config
n/s/q> n
name> remote
Type of storage to configure.
Choose a number from below, or type in your own value
[snip]
XX / Pcloud
   \ "pcloud"
[snip]
Storage> pcloud
Pcloud App Client Id - leave blank normally.
client_id> 
Pcloud App Client Secret - leave blank normally.
client_secret> 
Remote config
Use auto config?
 * Say Y if not sure
 * Say N if you are working on a remote or headless machine
y) Yes
n) No
y/n> y
If your browser doesn't open automatically go to the following link: http://127.0.0.1:53682/auth
Log in and authorize rclone for access
Waiting for code...
Got code
--------------------
[remote]
client_id = 
client_secret = 
token = {"access_token":"XXX","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
--------------------
y) Yes this is OK
e) Edit this remote
d) Delete this remote
y/e/d> y
```

See the [remote setup docs](/remote_setup/) for how to set it up on a
machine with no Internet browser available.

Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect the
token as returned from pCloud. This only runs from the moment it opens
your browser to the moment you get back the verification code.  This
is on `http://127.0.0.1:53682/` and this it may require you to unblock
it temporarily if you are running a host firewall.

Once configured you can then use `rclone` like this,

List directories in top level of your pCloud

    rclone lsd remote:

List all the files in your pCloud

    rclone ls remote:

To copy a local directory to an pCloud directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

### Modified time and hashes ###

pCloud allows modification times to be set on objects accurate to 1
second.  These will be used to detect whether objects need syncing or
not.  In order to set a Modification time pCloud requires the object
be re-uploaded.

pCloud supports MD5 and SHA1 hashes in the US region, and SHA1 and SHA256
hashes in the EU region, so you can use the `--checksum` flag.

### Restricted filename characters

In addition to the [default restricted characters set](/overview/#restricted-characters)
the following characters are also replaced:

| Character | Value | Replacement |
| --------- |:-----:|:-----------:|
| \         | 0x5C  | ï¼¼          |

Invalid UTF-8 bytes will also be [replaced](/overview/#invalid-utf8),
as they can't be used in JSON strings.

### Deleting files

Deleted files will be moved to the trash.  Your subscription level
will determine how long items stay in the trash.  `rclone cleanup` can
be used to empty the trash.

### Root folder ID

You can set the `root_folder_id` for rclone.  This is the directory
(identified by its `Folder ID`) that rclone considers to be the root
of your pCloud drive.

Normally you will leave this blank and rclone will determine the
correct root to use itself.

However you can set this to restrict rclone to a specific folder
hierarchy.

In order to do this you will have to find the `Folder ID` of the
directory you wish rclone to display.  This will be the `folder` field
of the URL when you open the relevant folder in the pCloud web
interface.

So if the folder you want rclone to use has a URL which looks like
`https://my.pcloud.com/#page=filemanager&folder=5xxxxxxxx8&tpl=foldergrid`
in the browser, then you use `5xxxxxxxx8` as
the `root_folder_id` in the config.
