# rclone serve restic

Serve the remote for restic's REST API.

## Synopsis

rclone serve restic implements restic's REST backend API
over HTTP.  This allows restic to use rclone as a data storage
mechanism for cloud providers that restic does not support directly.

[Restic](https://restic.net/) is a command line program for doing
backups.

The server will log errors.  Use -v to see access logs.

--bwlimit will be respected for file transfers.  Use --stats to
control the stats printing.

## Setting up rclone for use by restic ###

First [set up a remote for your chosen cloud provider](/docs/#configure).

Once you have set up the remote, check it is working with, for example
"rclone lsd remote:".  You may have called the remote something other
than "remote:" - just substitute whatever you called it in the
following instructions.

Now start the rclone restic server

    rclone serve restic -v remote:backup

Where you can replace "backup" in the above by whatever path in the
remote you wish to use.

By default this will serve on "localhost:8080" you can change this
with use of the "--addr" flag.

You might wish to start this server on boot.

Adding --cache-objects=false will cause rclone to stop caching objects
returned from the List call. Caching is normally desirable as it speeds
up downloading objects, saves transactions and uses very little memory.

## Setting up restic to use rclone ###

Now you can [follow the restic
instructions](http://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html#rest-server)
on setting up restic.

Note that you will need restic 0.8.2 or later to interoperate with
rclone.

For the example above you will want to use "http://localhost:8080/" as
the URL for the REST server.

For example:

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/
    $ export RESTIC_PASSWORD=yourpassword
    $ restic init
    created restic backend 8b1a4b56ae at rest:http://localhost:8080/

    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
    the repository. Losing your password means that your data is
    irrecoverably lost.
    $ restic backup /path/to/files/to/backup
    scan [/path/to/files/to/backup]
    scanned 189 directories, 312 files in 0:00
    [0:00] 100.00%  38.128 MiB / 38.128 MiB  501 / 501 items  0 errors  ETA 0:00
    duration: 0:00
    snapshot 45c8fdd8 saved

### Multiple repositories ####

Note that you can use the endpoint to host multiple repositories.  Do
this by adding a directory name or path after the URL.  Note that
these **must** end with /.  Eg

    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user1repo/
    # backup user1 stuff
    $ export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=rest:http://localhost:8080/user2repo/
    # backup user2 stuff

### Private repositories ####

The "--private-repos" flag can be used to limit users to repositories starting
with a path of `/<username>/`.

## Server options

Use --addr to specify which IP address and port the server should
listen on, e.g. --addr 1.2.3.4:8000 or --addr :8080 to listen to all
IPs.  By default it only listens on localhost.  You can use port
:0 to let the OS choose an available port.

If you set --addr to listen on a public or LAN accessible IP address
then using Authentication is advised - see the next section for info.

--server-read-timeout and --server-write-timeout can be used to
control the timeouts on the server.  Note that this is the total time
for a transfer.

--max-header-bytes controls the maximum number of bytes the server will
accept in the HTTP header.

--baseurl controls the URL prefix that rclone serves from.  By default
rclone will serve from the root.  If you used --baseurl "/rclone" then
rclone would serve from a URL starting with "/rclone/".  This is
useful if you wish to proxy rclone serve.  Rclone automatically
inserts leading and trailing "/" on --baseurl, so --baseurl "rclone",
--baseurl "/rclone" and --baseurl "/rclone/" are all treated
identically.

--template allows a user to specify a custom markup template for http
and webdav serve functions.  The server exports the following markup
to be used within the template to server pages:

| Parameter   | Description |
| :---------- | :---------- |
| .Name       | The full path of a file/directory. |
| .Title      | Directory listing of .Name |
| .Sort       | The current sort used.  This is changeable via ?sort= parameter |
|             | Sort Options: namedirfirst,name,size,time (default namedirfirst) |
| .Order      | The current ordering used.  This is changeable via ?order= parameter |
|             | Order Options: asc,desc (default asc) |
| .Query      | Currently unused. |
| .Breadcrumb | Allows for creating a relative navigation |
|-- .Link     | The relative to the root link of the Text. |
|-- .Text     | The Name of the directory. |
| .Entries    | Information about a specific file/directory. |
|-- .URL      | The 'url' of an entry.  |
|-- .Leaf     | Currently same as 'URL' but intended to be 'just' the name. |
|-- .IsDir    | Boolean for if an entry is a directory or not. |
|-- .Size     | Size in Bytes of the entry. |
|-- .ModTime  | The UTC timestamp of an entry. |

### Authentication

By default this will serve files without needing a login.

You can either use an htpasswd file which can take lots of users, or
set a single username and password with the --user and --pass flags.

Use --htpasswd /path/to/htpasswd to provide an htpasswd file.  This is
in standard apache format and supports MD5, SHA1 and BCrypt for basic
authentication.  Bcrypt is recommended.

To create an htpasswd file:

    touch htpasswd
    htpasswd -B htpasswd user
    htpasswd -B htpasswd anotherUser

The password file can be updated while rclone is running.

Use --realm to set the authentication realm.

### SSL/TLS

By default this will serve over http.  If you want you can serve over
https.  You will need to supply the --cert and --key flags.  If you
wish to do client side certificate validation then you will need to
supply --client-ca also.

--cert should be either a PEM encoded certificate or a concatenation
of that with the CA certificate.  --key should be the PEM encoded
private key and --client-ca should be the PEM encoded client
certificate authority certificate.
