# rclone purge

Remove the path and all of its contents.

## Synopsis


Remove the path and all of its contents.  Note that this does not obey
include/exclude filters - everything will be removed.  Use the
[delete](/commands/rclone_delete/) command if you want to selectively
delete files. To delete empty directories only, use command
[rmdir](/commands/rclone_rmdir/) or [rmdirs](/commands/rclone_rmdirs/).

**Important**: Since this can cause data loss, test first with the
`--dry-run` or the `--interactive`/`-i` flag.


```
rclone purge remote:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for purge
```

See the [global flags page](/flags/) for global options not listed here.
