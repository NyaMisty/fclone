# rclone copyurl

Copy url content to dest.

## Synopsis


Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving
it in temporary storage.

Setting `--auto-filename` will cause the file name to be retrieved from
the URL (after any redirections) and used in the destination
path. With `--print-filename` in addition, the resulting file name will
be printed.

Setting `--no-clobber` will prevent overwriting file on the 
destination if there is one with the same name.

Setting `--stdout` or making the output file name `-`
will cause the output to be written to standard output.


```
rclone copyurl https://example.com dest:path [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -a, --auto-filename    Get the file name from the URL and use it for destination file path
  -h, --help             help for copyurl
      --no-clobber       Prevent overwriting file with same name
  -p, --print-filename   Print the resulting name from --auto-filename
      --stdout           Write the output to stdout rather than a file
```
