# rclone test info

Discovers file name or other limitations for paths.

## Synopsis

rclone info discovers what filenames and upload methods are possible
to write to the paths passed in and how long they can be.  It can take some
time.  It will write test files into the remote:path passed in.  It outputs
a bit of go code for each one.

**NB** this can create undeletable files and other hazards - use with care


```
rclone test info [remote:path]+ [flags]
