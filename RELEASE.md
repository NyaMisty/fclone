# Release

This file describes how to make the various kinds of releases

## Extra required software for making a release

  * [gh the github cli](https://github.com/cli/cli) for uploading packages
  * pandoc for making the html and man pages

## Making a release

  * git checkout master # see below for stable branch
  * git pull
  * git status - make sure everything is checked in
  * Check GitHub actions build for master is Green
  * make test # see integration test server or run locally
  * make tag
  * edit docs/content/changelog.md # make sure to remove duplicate logs from point releases
  * make tidy
  * make doc
  * git status - to check for new man pages - git add them
  * git commit -a -v -m "Version v1.XX.0"
  * make retag
  * git push --follow-tags origin
  * # Wait for the GitHub builds to complete then...
  * make fetch_binaries
  * make tarball
  * make vendorball
  * make sign_upload
  * make check_sign
  * make upload
  * make upload_website
  * make upload_github
  * make startdev # make startstable for stable branch
  * # announce with forum post, twitter post, patreon post

## Update dependencies

Early in the next release cycle update the dependencies

  * Review any pinned packages in go.mod and remove if possible
  * make updatedirect
  * make
  * git commit -a -v
  * make update
  * make
  * roll back any updates which didn't compile
  * git commit -a -v --amend

Note that `make update` updates all direct and indirect dependencies
and there can occasionally be forwards compatibility problems with
doing that so it may be necessary to roll back dependencies to the
version specified by `make updatedirect` in order to get rclone to
build.

## Making a point release

If rclone needs a point release due to some horrendous bug:

Set vars

  * BASE_TAG=v1.XX          # e.g. v1.52
  * NEW_TAG=${BASE_TAG}.Y   # e.g. v1.52.1
  * echo $BASE_TAG $NEW_TAG # v1.52 v1.52.1

First make the release branch.  If this is a second point release then
this will be done already.

  * git branch ${BASE_TAG} ${BASE_TAG}-stable
  * git co ${BASE_TAG}-stable
  * make startstable

Now

  * git co ${BASE_TAG}-stable
  * git cherry-pick any fixes
  * Do the steps as above
  * make startstable
  * git co master
  * `#` cherry pick the changes to the changelog - check the diff to make sure it is correct
  * git checkout ${BASE_TAG}-stable docs/content/changelog.md
  * git commit -a -v -m "Changelog updates from Version ${NEW_TAG}"
  * git push

## Making a manual build of docker

The rclone docker image should autobuild on via GitHub actions.  If it doesn't
or needs to be updated then rebuild like this.

See: https://github.com/ilteoood/docker_buildx/issues/19
See: https://github.com/ilteoood/docker_buildx/blob/master/scripts/install_buildx.sh

```
git co v1.54.1
docker pull golang
export DOCKER_CLI_EXPERIMENTAL=enabled
docker buildx create --name actions_builder --use
docker run --rm --privileged docker/binfmt:820fdd95a9972a5308930a2bdfb8573dd4447ad3
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS=$(docker buildx inspect --bootstrap | grep 'Platforms:*.*' | cut -d : -f2,3)
echo "Supported platforms: $SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS"
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/386,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t rclone/rclone:1.54.1 -t rclone/rclone:1.54 -t rclone/rclone:1 -t rclone/rclone:latest --push .
docker buildx stop actions_builder
```

### Old build for linux/amd64 only

```
docker pull golang
docker build --rm --ulimit memlock=67108864  -t rclone/rclone:1.52.0 -t rclone/rclone:1.52 -t rclone/rclone:1 -t rclone/rclone:latest .
docker push rclone/rclone:1.52.0
docker push rclone/rclone:1.52
docker push rclone/rclone:1
docker push rclone/rclone:latest
```
